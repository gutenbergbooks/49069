<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>The diagrammatic portrayal of the relief of continental land areas of the
world has been completed by both the late A. K. Lobeck and Erwin Raisz,
whose magnificent diagrams are familiar to all geologists and geographers. The
authors of the present sheet are preparing a similar series of marine physiographic
diagrams.</p>

<p><em>The Physiographic Diagram: Atlantic Ocean; Sheet 1</em> is the first of this
projected series. The Atlantic Ocean diagram will consist of five sheets at a
scale of about 1:5 million. A diagram of the South Atlantic Ocean at a scale of
about 1:11 million now nearly completed will form the first of a general series
planned to portray the world oceans.</p>

<p>In addition, diagrams of selected areas well covered by sounding profiles will
be prepared at scales of about 1:2 million.</p>

<p>Each sheet or series of sheets will be accompanied by descriptive notes treating
the nomenclature, morphological, geological, and geophysical characteristics
of each of the physiographic provinces.</p>

<p><em>Lamont Geological Observatory Contribution 308</em></p>


<h3>NOTE</h3>

<p class="center"><em>Physiographic Diagram: Atlantic Ocean, Sheet 1 (Plate 1)</em></p>

<p>Copies of the Physiographic Diagram: Atlantic Ocean, Sheet 1 are available
unfolded so that each will be suitable for wall mounting. The diagram is therefore
not physically inserted or attached to this volume although it forms the
basic part of the paper.</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>


<p>The studies of submarine topography at the Lamont Geological Observatory
have been supported by the United States Navy Bureau of Ships under Contract
NObsr 64547. The expeditions which obtained topographic data were supported
by the Office of Naval Research under Contracts N6 onr 27124 and N6 onr
27113 and the Bureau of Ships under Contract NObsr 64547. Three cruises
were supported by the National Geographic Society, the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, and Columbia University. Financial support has been received
from The Geological Society of America (Grant 635-54). The preparation
of this paper was supported in part by the Bell Telephone Laboratories.</p>

<p>The studies that led to the present paper began at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution just after World War II. With the founding of the Lamont
Geological Observatory in 1949 the work was transferred to that observatory at
Palisades, New York. Topographic data from Woods Hole cruises were incorporated
with Lamont data until 1953, when a separate program was established
at Woods Hole by J. B. Hersey, and Columbia University acquired the
<span class="smcap">Vema</span> as its own research vessel. Although Woods Hole data obtained between
1953 and 1957 have not been used in preparing sheet 1, arrangements recently
concluded provide for the incorporation of past and future Woods Hole data in
subsequent sheets of this series.</p>

<p>The soundings were read, compiled, and plotted by Morris Wirshup, the late
Andrew Nelson, Ivan Tolstoy, G. Leonard Johnson, III, the authors, and several
others. The profiles were plotted by M. Wirshup, Hester Haring, the authors,
and several others.</p>

<p>The soundings were taken primarily on board the Research Vessels <span class="smcap">Vema</span>
and <span class="smcap">Atlantis</span> (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution), but important sounding
lines were obtained by the R/V <span class="smcap">Albatross</span> (Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution), M/V <span class="smcap">Theta</span>, and R/V <span class="smcap">Caryn</span> (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution)
and in the eastern Atlantic by the R.R.S. <span class="smcap">Discovery</span> (National Institute
of Oceanography).</p>

<p>The following officers made outstanding contributions to the navigational
plotting: A. K. Lane, the late A. Karlson, J. Pike, R/V <span class="smcap">Atlantis</span>; D. Gould,
the late F. S. Usher, D. Smith, V. Sinclair, H. Kohler, and K. Simonson, R/V
<span class="smcap">Vema</span>; and the late A. Nelson, R/V <span class="smcap">Vema</span> and M/V <span class="smcap">Theta</span>.</p>

<p>The echo sounders have been installed, maintained, and improved by B. Luskin,
H. R. Johnson, A. Roberts, M. Landisman, C. Hubbard, H. Van Santford,
M. Langseth, G. Sutton, and many others.</p>

<p>The entire scientific party of each of the more than 50 expeditions represented
in the data of this paper took turns marking and adjusting the echo sounder,
and all navigational officers on these expeditions took the fixes and kept the logs.
To these sea-going scientists and mariners too numerous to list the authors are
extremely grateful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Soundings in the northeast Atlantic compiled by the British Admiralty Hydrographic
Department were kindly provided by Cmdr. J. S. N. Pryor of that
organization. Dr. M. N. Hill of Cambridge and Dr. G. E. R. Deacon of the
(British) National Institute of Oceanography were instrumental in obtaining
many of these valuable deep-sea soundings. Original sounding sheets of many
areas were provided by the Coast and Geodetic Survey through the courtesy of
Admiral A. Karo and Mr. G. F. Jordan.</p>

<p>B. Luskin's development of the Precision Depth Recorder and his continued
research and development in echo-sounding equipment made it possible to obtain
many of the detailed data of this paper.</p>

<p>The following expedition chief scientists conducted sounding surveys which
have been incorporated in this paper: M. Ewing, J. L. Worzel, J. E. Nafe,
I. Tolstoy, R. S. Edwards, G. R. Hamilton, C. L. Drake, B. Luskin, W. C.
Beckmann, F. Press, J. Northrop, J. Hirshman, M. J. Davidson, R. J. Menzies,
F. C. Fuglister, E. T. Miller, and B. C. Heezen.</p>

<p>The writers are grateful to the great number of scientists who encouraged
them in this work and especially to those who offered suggestions and discussed
the data and conclusions. We are particularly indebted to W. H. Bucher for
discussions relative to tectonics, to David B. Ericson for problems relating to
sediment distribution and analysis, and to C. O'D. Iselin and C. H. Elmendorf
for general encouragement and support during the several years of this study.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>


<p>The Physiographic Diagram: Atlantic Ocean, Sheet 1, which portrays the
North Atlantic between 17&deg; and 50&deg; North Latitude, is the first of a projected
series of diagrams. The diagram is based on continuous echo-sounding traverses
made by research vessels. The relief shown on the profiles was sketched in perspective
using the technique introduced by Lobeck. Between sounding profiles
the relief is speculative, based on extrapolation of trends noted in the profiles.</p>

<p>The area of the diagram is divided into three major physiographic regions
which are in turn subdivided into the following categories of provinces.</p>

<ul><li class="indx">CONTINENTAL MARGIN</li>

<li class="isub1"><em>Category I</em></li>
<li class="isub2">Continental Shelf</li>
<li class="isub2">Epicontinental Seas</li>
<li class="isub2">Marginal Plateaus</li>

<li class="isub1"><em>Category II</em></li>
<li class="isub2">Continental Slope</li>
<li class="isub2">Marginal Escarpments</li>
<li class="isub2">Landward Slopes of Trenches</li>

<li class="isub1"><em>Category III</em></li>
<li class="isub2">Continental Rise</li>
<li class="isub2">Marginal Trench-Outer Ridge Complex</li>
<li class="isub2">Marginal Basin-Outer Ridge Complex</li>

<li class="indx">OCEAN BASIN FLOOR</li>

<li class="isub1"><em>Oceanic Rises</em></li>

<li class="isub1"><em>Seamount Groups</em></li>

<li class="indx">MID-OCEANIC RIDGE</li>

<li class="isub1"><em>Crest Provinces</em></li>

<li class="isub2">Upper Step</li>
<li class="isub2">Middle Step</li>
<li class="isub2">Lower Step</li>
</ul>

<p>Each province is defined, briefly described, and illustrated with profiles and
photographs of echo-sounding records.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the physiographic provinces, defined solely by bottom
topography, show good correlation with variations in crustal structure as determined
by seismic-refraction measurements and with anomalies of the gravity
and magnetic fields. In addition, the province boundaries correlate well with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
distribution patterns of bottom sediments. The physiographic provinces are thus
really morpho-tectonic provinces. The precise correlation of topographic provinces
and structure observed in specific sections can thus be extrapolated along
province boundaries to deduce the geology in large areas where no geophysical
work has been done. The tectonic map of the Atlantic prepared in this manner
will be presented in a subsequent publication.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_1_PREPARATION_OF_THE_PHYSIOGRAPHIC" id="PART_1_PREPARATION_OF_THE_PHYSIOGRAPHIC">PART 1. PREPARATION OF THE PHYSIOGRAPHIC
DIAGRAM</a></h2>


<p>Several steps are involved in the preparation of a marine physiographic diagram.
The raw data consist of continuously recorded echograms and lists of positions
of the research ship. Echograms are profiles of ocean depth, automatically
plotted against time (Luskin <em>et al.</em>, 1954). The first step is to read and tabulate
the depth at each peak, trough, or change of slope. These readings are plotted
on a chart (1:1,000,000) as a series of closely spaced soundings. Depth profiles
are plotted against distance at a standard vertical exaggeration of 40:1. The
sounding lines are also plotted on a chart of small scale (1:5,000,000) which is
at the same scale as the final physiographic diagram. The subsequent steps in the
preparation of the diagram are illustrated by Figures 1<em>a-d</em>. The exaggerated
profiles (1<em>b</em>) along the tracks (1<em>a</em>) show a succession of peaks and valleys. These
features are sketched in along the tracks (1<em>c</em>). After all the tracks in a large area
are sketched in this way, the major trends are estimated, and the diagram is completed
by interpolation and extrapolation (Fig. 1<em>d</em>; Pl. 1). The vertical scale of
the diagram is 1 inch = 5000 fathoms which is an effective vertical exaggeration
of 20 to 1. The final diagram as printed is at a scale of 1:5 million at 40&deg; N. on a
Mercator projection.</p>

<p>There is a fundamental difference between the preparation of a terrestrial and
a marine physiographic diagram. In the former the major problem is to select
from more-detailed maps the features to be represented. Except in unexplored,
inaccessible areas, the shape of all land features is a matter of recorded fact; the
problem is to abstract and artfully draw the features in question. In contrast, the
preparation of a marine physiographic diagram requires the author to postulate
the patterns and trends of the relief on the basis of cross sections and then to
portray this interpretation in the diagram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">PHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCE CHART</span>: A study of the exaggerated profiles
plotted during the preparation of the physiographic diagram revealed the existence
of morphological features and morphological provinces not previously delineated.
The limits of areas of contrasting morphology were noted on the profiles,
and these points were plotted on a chart of small scale (also about 1:5 million

<p><span class="smcap">CONTROL</span>: Almost all the echo-sounding profiles used in the preparation of
the physiographic diagram (Pl. 1) and the physiographic province chart (Pl. 20)
were obtained by expeditions of the Lamont Geological Observatory and the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Pl. 21). Some soundings were provided
by the Hydrographic Department, British Admiralty (Pl. 21) and the International
Hydrographic Bureau (Monaco).</p>

<p>The echo soundings made by research vessels fall into three classes: (1) precision
soundings (accuracy better than 1 fathom in 3000); (2) nonprecision
soundings obtained by research vessels using commercial echo sounders with
control or close check on time standard; (3) poor to bad soundings made with
commercial echo sounders without timing control or adequate checks. Most of
the soundings used in this paper fall into the first two categories. In Figure 2 the
Precision Depth Recorder (PDR) sounding tracks are shown. In Figure 3 the
good but nonprecision tracks are shown. The soundings of the third class are
not shown. All tracks used in the preparation of the diagram are shown in Plate
21. Most of the sounding lines were located by standard dead-reckoning procedures
from astronomical fixes. Errors of a few miles are probably common.
Position errors do not seriously affect the work described here since we are dealing
largely with texture read from profiles and plotted on a small-scale sheet.</p>

<p>In addition to the sounding tracks shown in the control chart, spot depths
shown on U. S. Hydrographic Office charts HO 0955a, 0955b, 0956a, 0956b, and
5487 and on feuille A-1 of the Carte G&eacute;n&eacute;rale Bathym&eacute;trique des Oc&eacute;ans (1935)
were used where profiles were lacking. Along the east coast of the United States
the Coast and Geodetic Survey soundings published by Veatch and Smith
(1939) were used for the continental shelf and slope. Other important sources
of published soundings include Hill (1956), De Andrade (1937), Dietrich
(1939), W&uuml;st (1940a), Emery (1950), and Tolstoy (1951).</p>

<p>The land areas of the diagram were sketched to the same rigid vertical scale
as that used for the deep sea. Elevations for the United States were taken from
United States Geological Survey and Army Map Service quadrangle maps;
elevations for Europe and Africa are from Bartholomew maps; and elevations
for the islands from United States Navy Hydrographic Office charts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">EXAGGERATED PROFILES</span>: The profiles plotted at 40:1 vertical exaggeration are
the basis for the topography sketched on the physiographic diagram. A selection
of these profiles is reproduced in Plates 22, 24, 25, and 27, and in Figure 45. All
profiles from precision soundings were originally plotted at a vertical scale of 2
inches equals 1000 fathoms and a horizontal scale of 2 inches equals 40 miles.
Nonprecision soundings were plotted at scales of 1 inch equals 1000 fathoms and
1 inch equals 40 miles. In a typical area 40 to 60 soundings were plotted for each
60 miles of profile. The points were connected and then qualitatively checked
against the original echogram. Although all the larger features are represented
on these profiles, features of less than a mile in width may be missed. The small
scale of the physiographic diagram excluded the possibility of portraying most
of the features less than 3-6 miles in width and less than 20 fathoms in height.</p>

<p>Detailed study of the small-scale features less than 2 or 3 miles in width is
best accomplished by a study of the original echograms. The PDR records are
ideal for this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">NORTH ATLANTIC SOUNDINGS</span>: The study of the North Atlantic deep-sea
bathymetry began a little more than a century ago with the taking of the first
deep-sea soundings by lead line. By 1860, largely because of the great public interest
in the proposed trans-Atlantic cables and the enthusiastic encouragement
of Matthew F. Maury (1855), several hundred soundings had been taken in
the North Atlantic in depths greater than 1000 fathoms. Meanwhile, on either
side of the Atlantic surveys of coasts, harbors, offshore banks, and the continental
shelf were being made for navigational use. The Hudson Submarine Channel and
the head of the Hudson Canyon were discovered by the United States Coast
Survey during this period. By 1912 more than 1800 deep-sea soundings had been
taken in the North Atlantic by the laborious method of using a lead lowered at
first by hemp line and later by wire. Between 1900 and 1920 Fessenden in the
United States, Behm in Germany, and Langevin and Florisson in France established
that acoustic echo sounding was possible and built machines to take echo
soundings. In 1922, echo sounding became a practical operation. Although many
of the early echo sounders were fitted with automatic recorders, they were in
general suitable only for use in shallow water (less than 500 fathoms). Deep-sea
echo soundings were obtained by listening on earphones for the returning echo
and timing the interval by eye with a suitable clock. The improvement of sounding
gear continued, and by the mid 1930's automatic recording deep-sea echo
sounders were manufactured and put into limited use, although, by and large, all
pre-World War II deep-sea (&gt; 1000 fathoms) echo soundings were discrete
observations by the "ear and eye" method. A good review of pre-World War II
echo-sounding apparatus is given in a publication of the International Hydrographic
Bureau (Anon., 1939). During the war the NMC<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> echo sounder was
developed and installed on many U. S. ships. It was adequate for deep-sea sounding
if in perfect condition; but the designers, being cautious, had arranged for
recording only in the depth range of 0-2000 fathoms. The NMC sounder on
Atlantis was modified to record in greater depths in 1945, and many thousands
of miles of tracks were obtained of the deep sea with this apparatus. The NMC
had a small record chart (6&frac14; inches = 2000 fathoms; &frac12; inch = about 3 miles).
The precision was low since the apparatus depended on a ship's regular AC
power supply for its time standard. A new sounder, the UQN-1B, was developed
in the United States following World War II. The instrument as manufactured
recorded on an extremely small chart (8 inches = 6000 fathoms) but could be
modified for multiple 600-fathom scale recording (8 inches = 600 fathoms). The
timing function was usually accomplished by poorly regulated ship's AC power
supply, and errors were consequently large (Dietz, 1954; Heezen, 1954). In
addition, the stylus arrangement required constant adjustment. After only a few
thousand miles were obtained by the Lamont Observatory expeditions it became
obvious that a new recorder incorporating precision timing and large recorder
presentation was necessary for an adequate knowledge of topography.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> U. S. Navy designation.</p></div>

<p>Bernard Luskin of the Lamont Geological Observatory, in co-operation with
the Times Facsimile Company, adapted the Times Facsimile receiver to do the
timing and recording function of the echo sounder, using a standard UQN receiver
and transmitter (without recorder). More than 200,000 miles of PDR
soundings have now been obtained by expeditions of the Lamont Geological Observatory.
The apparatus originally described by Luskin <em>et al.</em> (1954) has been
extensively improved (Luskin and Israel, 1956). The Times Facsimile-Lamont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
PDR performs the timing and recording functions with an accuracy of better
than 1 fathom in 3000. This was a considerable improvement over older apparatus.
The PDR generally uses multiple 400-fathom scales in which 400 fathoms
is represented by 18&frac34; inches of record; the paper is carried through the machines
at 24 inches an hour. Other vertical scales (<em>i. e.</em>, 200, 800, 1200) can easily
be provided, and the paper transport can be changed by steps from 12 to 96
inches per hour. The laminated recording paper consists of two layers of light
gray and a center layer of black. The record is made by burning the upper gray
layer and thus exposing the underlying dark layer. The facsimile recording paper
differs from the conventional echo-sounder record paper in that a greater range
of shades can be reproduced. Several PDR records are shown in the following
text (Pls. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18). Effective study of the physiography
of the deep-sea floor was made possible by introduction of the PDR.
Echo soundings obtained by the English in the area southwest of England have
been used in the present study. The accuracy of their equipment has not been adequately
treated in the literature, but it appears by comparison that most soundings
are accurate to within at least 1 per cent.</p>

<h2>PART 2. PHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCES</h2>


<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Descriptions of physical features of the earth's surface are found in the
earliest-known writings. However, the systematic classification of land forms is
relatively recent and followed the development of the science of physical geology.
The natural topographic divisions of the continents have been classified into
physiographic provinces according to several similar systems (Lobeck, 1939;
Fenneman, 1938; Atwood, 1940; and others). These systems take into account
form and age of the relief, as well as the structure of the underlying rocks. Descriptions
are usually given in terms of age, process, and structure, with the ultimate
aim the understanding of the origin and history of topography. Detailed
topographic maps at 1:50,000 or larger are available and are used in conjunction
with direct field observations. More recently aerial photographs have greatly
aided geomorphic studies.</p>

<p>The oceans, in contrast, have been subdivided by oceanographers merely into
basins separated by ridges and swells. This was done on the basis of widely
spaced discrete soundings shown on charts rarely of larger scale than 1:10 million.
The basins were delimited by arbitrarily chosen and often crudely controlled
isobaths. The development and installation of continuously recording deep-sea
echo sounders and their extensive use in the deep sea provide for the first time
detailed topographic information on the deep-sea floor and thus a new basis for
description and classification.</p>

<p>It is perhaps presumptuous at this time to refer to the topographic divisions
of the sea floor as physiographic provinces when we have only scant information
concerning the structure of each province, the age, the physical processes, and, in
fact, the details of topography. Therefore, the classification described in the following
pages is presented as a first attempt, with the full knowledge that it will
be modified and expanded by subsequent exploration.</p>

<p>We are only beginning to understand the structural significance of deep-sea
physiographic provinces. We now think that the correlation of topography and
structure will be better under the sea than on land because of less vigorous
erosion at depth in the sea. If this is true, deep-sea structural patterns may eventually
be quite simple to map.</p>


<h3>NOMENCLATURE AND CLASSIFICATION OF DEEP-SEA RELIEF</h3>

<p>Before the advent of continuously recorded echo-sounding profiles, and their
revelation of the texture of the sea-floor relief, classification and nomenclature of
submarine topography were based on broad closed isobaths. We can characterize
the older system as the bathymetric system of nomenclature in contrast to
that employed in this paper, which we can call a geomorphic or textural system.</p>

<p>The terms "basin" and "deep" used in the older literature are usually defined
by closed 3000-, 4000-, or 5000-meter contours as represented on the Carte G&eacute;n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>&eacute;rale
Bathym&eacute;trique des Oc&eacute;ans (International Hydrographic Bureau). For
many purposes this terminology is useful, particularly in describing the habitat of
a deep-sea fish or the locale of a water mass. Consequently some such system
should be retained even though in many areas basin boundaries are difficult to
define, and regardless of the fact that many boundaries cut arbitrarily through
physiographic provinces without regard for local province boundaries. The Atlantic
has been subdivided by W&uuml;st (1940b) (Fig. 4) whose system is now in
general use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/fig04.jpg" width="700" height="357" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure 4.</span>&mdash;<em>Major basins of the North Atlantic, after W&uuml;st (1940)</em></p>

<p>Heavy solid lines indicate boundary formed by axis of Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Light solid
lines indicate boundary formed by shelf breaks and submarine ridges. Dashed lines indicate
arbitrary boundaries.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The nomenclature of deep-sea topography has been considered by several
committees during the past half century. The most recent recommendations published
by Wiseman and Ovey (1953; 1955) are followed wherever applicable.
The older systems of nomenclature, however, are not rigidly employed since we
are dealing with textural provinces based on profiles obtained with continuously
recording echo sounders rather than bathymetric provinces defined by closed
isobaths.</p>


<h3>UNITS OF DEPTH AND SLOPE</h3>

<p>On the profiles and echograms the vertical scale is in units of echo-sounding
time rather than in units of true depth. In other words, all depths are calculated
under the assumption that the vertical sound velocity is 800 fathoms per second.
Considering that the sound travels to the bottom and back, the calculation is
based on 400 fathoms per second of lapsed time.</p>

<p>Since the average vertical velocity is, within the area covered, always slightly
less than 800 fathoms per second, the true depth is always slightly greater than
the "echo-time depth" as expressed in "nominal fathoms". Figure 5 shows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
range of corrections which must be applied in various parts of the area. The spot
depths indicated on the physiographic diagram are in units of true depth corrected
according to Matthews' tables (1939) for regional variations in the average
vertical sounding velocity.</p>

referred to as gradients. In Figure 6 slope values expressed in degrees, per cent
grade, feet per statute mile, and gradient are compared. With a few exceptions
all profiles are represented with a 40:1 vertical exaggeration. To facilitate judging
the magnitude of slopes on these profiles, Figure 7 shows various gradient
ratios at a 40:1 vertical exaggeration. Slope corrections have not been made to
the soundings. Except in special cases such corrections would make insignificant
changes in the 40:1 profile.</p>

<h3>CONTINENT AND OCEAN</h3>

<p>The two first-order morphologic divisions of the earth's crust are continent
and ocean. The oceans can be divided into a few major divisions which are in
turn subdivided into categories of physiographic provinces and then into individual
provinces. The area of the present study is composed of the three major
divisions shown in Figure 9: continental margin, ocean-basin floor, and mid-oceanic
ridge. The discussion and description of the physiographic provinces of
the North Atlantic will follow the schematic outline shown in Figure 8.</p>

<h2>CONTINENTAL MARGIN</h2>


<h3>DEFINITION AND GENERAL CATEGORIES</h3>

<p>The continental margin includes those provinces of the continents and of the
oceans which are associated with the boundary between these two first-order
features of the earth.</p>

<p><em>General categories.</em>&mdash;In most areas three parallel categories of provinces can
be distinguished in the continental margin (Fig. 10). The relatively flat portions
of the submerged continental platform constitute category I. These provinces
are: continental shelf, epicontinental marginal seas (<em>e. g.</em>, Gulf of Maine), and
continental-margin plateaus (<em>e. g.</em>, Blake Plateau). The provinces of category II
include the continental slope, marginal escarpments (<em>e. g.</em>, Blake Escarpment),
and the landward slopes of trenches. These provinces mark the edge of the continental
block. Category III includes the continental rise, marginal trench-outer
ridge, and marginal basin-outer ridge complexes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/fig10.jpg" width="700" height="281" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure 10.</span>&mdash;<em>Three categories of continental-margin provinces</em></p>

<p>Category I provinces lie on the continental block, Category II provinces form the side
of the continental block, and Category III provinces are the upturned or depressed margins
of the oceanic depression.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The most common type of continental margin is made up of continental shelf
(I), continental slope (II), and continental rise (III). (Fig. 10, Sahara and
New York). In areas where the continental rise is well developed it is composed
of two parts, the upper and the lower continental rise (Fig. 15). In some areas
the lower continental rise is replaced by an outer ridge, and the upper continental
rise is replaced by a marginal basin or marginal trench. These two latter types
are illustrated in Figure 10 by profiles marked Blake Plateau and Puerto Rico
respectively. Seamounts and islands occur in all the continental-margin provinces.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Category I provinces.</em>&mdash;The ocean overflows its basin onto the edge of the
continents. The principal physiographic province of this submerged portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the continental platform is the continental shelf which is present off all the lands
of the world. The continental shelf is a smooth area with very low relief and is
nearly everywhere limited to depths less than 250 fathoms. The continental
blocks are also flooded by epicontinental seas. Some of these have rough bottoms,
as the Gulf of Maine; others are relatively smooth-floored. Marginal plateaus,
where present, lie in depths of 500-1200 fathoms, and many are nearly as smooth
as the continental shelves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">CONTINENTAL SHELF</span>: The continental shelf is a shallow (averaging less than
100 fathoms), gently sloping (less than 1:1000) surface of low local relief (less
than 10 fathoms) which extends from the shore line to the shelf break where
the seaward gradient sharply increases to greater than 1:40. Its width ranges
from a few miles to more than 200 miles.</p>

<p>Continental shelves border all land areas. Because of their proximity to shore,
their shallow depth, and their importance in navigation the continental shelves
are now the best-known part of the oceans (Veatch and Smith, 1939; Shepard,
1948).</p>

<p>The transition from the continental shelf to the continental slope is generally
abrupt and is known as the shelf break. This feature ranges in depth from 20 to
more than 100 fathoms and in form from a sharp edge to a rounded shoulder.
The change in the gradient is from less than 1:1000 to greater than 1:40.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">EPICONTINENTAL MARGINAL SEAS</span>: The epicontinental marginal seas are
those shallow seas (less than 1500 fathoms) which lie on the continental block
and can be distinguished from the continental shelves by their greater depth
(usually &gt; 100 fathoms) and possibly greater topographic irregularity. Most of
them are enclosed by shallow banks (&lt; 50 fathoms) of the continental shelf and
by land. The Gulf of Maine, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the channels of the
Bahamas belong to this class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MARGINAL PLATEAUS</span>: A marginal plateau is a shelflike feature which lies at
greater depths than the continental shelf and is separated from the continental
shelf by an incipient continental slope. These features generally lie at depths
greater than 100 fathoms and less than 1200 fathoms. They can be distinguished
from epicontinental marginal seas by their lack of a seaward barrier or sill. The
surface of a marginal plateau is generally quite similar to the continental shelf in
slope and in the frequency and magnitude of minor relief features. The Blake
Plateau is the only well-expressed representative of this morphologic type in the
area of the diagram. Well-developed marginal plateaus are also found off the
coast of southern Argentina and east of New Zealand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Category II provinces.</em>&mdash;The steep slopes which border the continental block
are grouped into category II provinces. Loosely speaking, we are referring to the
continental slope but, because of the complications imposed by such features as
marginal plateaus and marginal trenches, we distinguish three province types.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">CONTINENTAL SLOPE</span>: The continental slope is that relatively steep (3&deg;-6&deg;)
portion of the sea floor which lies at the seaward border of the continental shelf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
It typically drops from depths of 50-100 fathoms to depths of 750-1750 fathoms.
The top of the slope is usually well marked by a relatively sharp shelf break. The
base of the slope, although less definite, is generally abrupt. As a basis of classification
in those few areas where no abrupt change is noted, we have set the
gradient of 1:40 as the lowest gradient of the continental slope. The setting up
of a lower limit for the gradient marks a departure from the older usage in which
the continental slope was defined as "the slopes leading from the outer edge of
the continental shelves down to the great depths of the ocean" (Shepard, 1948).
This older definition included the continental rise, marginal plateaus, and marginal
escarpments. The continental slopes are a world-wide phenomenon. The
details of their regional distribution in the North Atlantic are covered in a later
section.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MARGINAL ESCARPMENTS</span>: A marginal escarpment is a precipitous escarpment
which forms the seaward slope of a marginal plateau. Such escarpments
begin in depths of 500-1500 fathoms and are 1000 to 2000 fathoms high. The
base of the escarpment is well marked by an abrupt change in slope. Gradients of
marginal escarpments exceed 1:10. The Blake Escarpment is a marginal escarpment.
Similar features are found in the Gulf of Mexico and off the southeast coast
of Argentina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LANDWARD SLOPES OF TRENCHES</span>: This term was introduced to set apart the
landward slopes of marginal trenches from the usual continental slopes found off
trench-less coasts. These steep slopes (&gt; 1:40) drop from depths of a few hundred
fathoms near a continent to a depth of a few thousand fathoms in a marginal
trench. In the North Atlantic the one example is north of Puerto Rico. A large
part of the circumference of the Pacific is bounded by such features.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Category III provinces.</em>&mdash;At the base of the continental slope a gentle gradient
continues to the local level of the abyssal floor. This seaward gradient ranges
from 1:100 to 1:700 and extends over a strip from a few miles to a few hundred
miles in width. On many topographic profiles made at right angles to the slope
of the continental margin three major breaks are visible: the shelf break, the
base of the continental slope, and the point where the near-by level of the ocean-basin
floor intersects the more steeply sloping continental margin. Since we have
limited the continental slope to gradients greater than 1:40, we split off this
lower portion of the continental margin into a separate province, the continental
rise. In the older "bathymetric" classification of relief the ocean basin&mdash;continental
slope boundary was along the 2000- or 2500-fathom contour, an arbitrary division
which cut across the then-unrecognized continental rise. At the base of the
Blake Escarpment lies an enclosed basin, and north of Puerto Rico the sea floor
drops almost directly to the floor of a marginal trench. These seemingly diverse
provinces of continental rise, marginal escarpments, enclosed marginal basins,
marginal trenches, and outer ridges are placed in category III because of their
similarity in position with respect to the continents and ocean floor and because
of other similarities shown in the deeper structure of the continental rise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">CONTINENTAL RISE</span>: The continental rise, where present, lies at the base of
the continental slope. Gradients on the continental rise generally range from
1:100 to 1:700, while the width ranges from a few score to a few hundred miles.
However, gradients as high as 1:50 are observed in segment 3 of the upper continental
rise, and gradients as low as 1:2500 are locally present in segment 2
of the lower continental rise (Tables 1 and 2). The seaward limit of the continental
rise is generally abrupt, and at this point regional gradients decrease to
less than 1:1000. The depth on the continental rise ranges from 750 to 2800
fathoms. Local relief is moderate to low, and, except for infrequent seamounts
and fairly frequent submarine canyons, the local relief of the continental rise
rarely exceeds 20 fathoms.</p>

<p>The continental rise is well developed over most of the area covered by the
physiographic diagram. The major exceptions are north of the Iberian Peninsula
where the rise is present, but extremely narrow, and in the southwestern third
of the map in the area south of Cape Hatteras, where it is not present. In this
latter area the geographical position usually filled by the continental rise is occupied
by the low, broad outer ridge and the enclosed marginal basin and marginal
trench.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">OUTER RIDGE</span>: An outer ridge is a broad ridge generally more than 100 miles
wide that rises from less than 100 fathoms to about 1000 fathoms above the adjacent
floor. It lies parallel to the continental margin and may enclose a basin or
trench on the landward side. The local relief of an outer ridge is generally a little
greater than that of the continental rise but much more subdued than that on the
oceanic rises and mid-oceanic ridges.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MARGINAL BASIN</span>: A marginal basin, where present, lies at the foot of the
continental slope or at the base of a marginal escarpment. It is slightly shallower
than the general level of the ocean basins and is bounded on the seaward side by
an outer ridge. Part of its floor is generally occupied by an abyssal plain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MARGINAL TRENCH</span>: A marginal trench is a narrow, steep-sided feature running
closely parallel to the trend of the continental margin; it is generally at least
1000 fathoms below the general level of the adjacent ocean floor. It is separated
from the ocean floor by a low outer ridge which rises 100-500 fathoms above the
level of the adjacent ocean floor. The bottom of a trench is generally rugged
except near the deepest spots where it is flat.</p>

<p>The combination of marginal basin and outer ridge replaces the continental
rise east of the Blake Plateau. North of Puerto Rico this combination is replaced
by a marginal trench-outer ridge complex. The reason for this grouping is discussed
in a later section.</p>

<p>Submarine canyons cut across all the continental-margin provinces except
isolated portions of the outer ridge. Submarine canyons range from less than a
mile to more than 10 miles in width and from less than 10 to nearly 1000 fathoms
in depth. Canyons are most abundant on the continental slope. However, a
smaller number persist across the continental rise. They are also found on the
marginal escarpments and on the landward slopes of trenches. Shepard (1948),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Kuenen (1950), Veatch and Smith (1939), De Andrade (1937), Johnson
(1939), and others have discussed the continental-slope canyons at great length.
Canyons in the continental rise of the North Atlantic were discovered and
mapped by Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen (1951).</p>

<h3>REGIONAL DESCRIPTION OF CONTINENTAL MARGIN</h3>

<p>This discussion is based on continuously recorded echo-sounding traverses
made by Lamont Geological Observatory expeditions. Profiles approximately
perpendicular to the continental margin are reproduced in Plates 24 and 25. None
is precisely perpendicular, and thus slight distortions of slopes and widths of the
features are unavoidable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">EASTERN NORTH AMERICA</span>: Thirty-four profiles of the continental margin of
eastern North America are presented in Plate 24. The positions of the profiles
are indicated on the index chart in Plate 23. All profiles show the three categories
of continental-margin provinces. Profiles W-1 to W-21 Plate 24 show the more
general succession of shelf, slope, and rise, while profiles W-22 to W-34 show
the outer ridge-marginal basin and outer ridge-marginal trench complexes. Each
of the 34 profiles exhibits a continental shelf although it may range from 20 to
300 miles in width. On each a shelf break is present at depths of 20-150 fathoms.
Each profile shows a continental slope, the base of which may be from 300 to
1900 fathoms deep.</p>

<p>Northern Grand Banks Sector.&mdash;On profiles W-1 to W-6 (Pl. 24), across
the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the shelf ranges from 120 to 285 miles in
width. Exceptionally strong local relief of 50-100 fathoms is found on the shelf
in profile W-1 northeastward from Newfoundland. The shelf break, which occurs
at 150 fathoms, is abnormally deep&mdash;more than twice the depths found off New
England. The continental slope has a typical gradient of 1:20 but is unusually
short as the continental rise is reached at 725 fathoms. From this depth the continental
rise descends to the 1700-fathom curve at a gradient of 1:140. This
gentle slope is interrupted by a group of exceptionally rugged lower continental
rise hills which rise to 1250 fathoms. Northeast of the hills the 2200-fathom line
marks the rather abrupt beginning of the abyssal plain which slopes seaward at
a gradient of 1:1100.</p>

<p>Flemish Cap.&mdash;Profile W-2 crosses the Grand Banks, along its widest east-west
axis, and also the semidetached bank called Flemish Cap. The shelf is much
smoother than in profile W-1, except for a small deep of about 100 fathoms immediately
east of Newfoundland. The shelf break at 150 fathoms is followed by a
continental slope 150 to 500 fathoms deep which has a gradient of 1:20. The
Flemish Cap is a difficult feature to classify. It is too large to be a seamount and
too shallow to be a marginal plateau. We must treat it as a part of the continental
shelf, semidetached from the rest by a 650-fathom-deep channel. The eastern
flank of the Flemish Cap slopes off at gradients of 1:100 and 1:60 until at a depth
of 650 fathoms the bottom drops precipitously to 1750 fathoms at a gradient of
1:10. Seaward of this point an 85-mile-wide continental rise has a gradient of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
1:65 and 1:250 down to the Newfoundland Abyssal Plain which is at a depth of
2400 fathoms. Twenty miles east of the continental rise this profile crosses the
Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Canyon.</p>

<p>On profile W-3 the shelf is quite smooth, and the shelf break is reached at 60
fathoms. The profile runs slightly oblique to the continental slope and reveals a
series of submarine canyons. The base of the slope is at 1700 fathoms where the
gradient drops to less than 1:200.</p>

</div>

<p>Southeast Newfoundland Ridge.&mdash;From the southern tip of the Grand Banks
a broad ridge runs southeasterly toward the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and forms a
natural barrier between the Newfoundland Basin and the North America Basin
[to the south]. Since it is almost impossible to define a boundary between the
continental rise and the ridge, we consider the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge
an extension of the continental rise. The ridge is 60-100 miles wide, and its crest
plunges southeastward from depths of 1500 fathoms near 50&deg; W. to depths of
2200 fathoms near 45&deg; W. Profiles N-1 and N-2 (Fig. 11) cross the Southeast
Newfoundland Ridge at about 41.5&deg; N. and 39.5&deg; N. respectively. Profile N-1 is
of poor quality, which probably accounts for the lack of fine-textured relief. The
Mid-Ocean Canyon is again seen at the eastern end of Profile N-2. Profile W-5
(Pl. 24) crosses the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge from north to south. The
similarity of profiles W-5 and W-23 suggests that the Southeast Newfoundland
Ridge is an outer ridge of the same kind as the one east of the Blake-Bahama
region. The northern one is not so long, and it does not totally enclose a basin.
Otherwise, it is quite similar to the outer ridge east of the Bahamas in relative
position, size, and surface features. The term Southeast Newfoundland Ridge
was proposed by W&uuml;st (1940b; 1943) and the feature has been shown on bathymetric
charts (Tolstoy, 1951) and profiles (Emery, 1950). This ridge will be
discussed again in connection with the Mid-Ocean Canyon and the ocean-basin
floor.</p>

<p>Southern Grand Banks Sector.&mdash;Profiles W-4 and W-5 cross the southern
tip of the Grand Banks. The shelf break is at 50 fathoms on both profiles. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Profile W-4 an apparent gradient of 1:25 extends from 200 to about 1000
fathoms where, after some irregularities probably associated with submarine canyons,
the gradient drops to 1:40. This lower gradient extends to 1750 fathoms.
Profile W-5 is quite similar to W-4 except that a steep initial slope of 1:5, from
about 200 fathoms to 650 fathoms, is followed by a gradient of 1:80 which continues
to 1000 fathoms. This same terracelike feature is also seen on W-3, W-4,
W-5, W-6, W-7, and W-8. Below 1000 fathoms a gradient of about 1:50 is found
on profiles W-4, W-5, W-6, W-7, and W-8. Profile W-6 runs south of the Grand
Banks through the epicenter of the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake and then south
through the area passed over by the 1929 Grand Banks turbidity current (Heezen
and Ewing, 1952). The depression marked by the 1150-fathom sounding on
the continental slope in Profile W-6 is a canyon running south from the Laurentian
Channel. The continental rise is 250 miles wide and has an average gradient
of 1:400 over its deepest third. At a depth of 2750 fathoms the gradient
abruptly drops to 1:2000, and this marks the northern edge of the Sohm
Abyssal Plain.</p>

<p>Profile replotted from NMC echogram</p></div>
</div>

<p>Laurentian Channel.&mdash;Between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland a 60-mile-wide,
steep-sided, flat-floored channel cuts across the continental shelf connecting
the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the open ocean. The nearly flat, smooth floor of this
channel lies at about 230 fathoms depth. Figure 12 shows a cross-section of the
Laurentian Channel near its seaward end. The origin and physiography of the
channel has been treated by Shepard (1931; 1948); its structure has been reported
by Press and Beckmann (1954). The Laurentian Channel continues as a
steep-sided, box-shaped feature for more than 500 miles into the Gulf of St.
Lawrence.</p>

<p>Scotian Shelf Sector.&mdash;The term Scotian Shelf was introduced by Canadian
oceanographers and refers to the continental shelf southeast of Nova Scotia from
the Laurentian Channel to the Gulf of Maine. This region is illustrated by Profiles
W-7, W-8, W-9, W-10, and W-11 which run at slightly different directions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
all starting in the vicinity of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Along the entire Scotian Shelf
a series of 120-fathom depressions are located 10 to 80 miles off shore. A nearly
continuous bank 20-60 fathoms deep and 10-25 miles wide lies along the seaward
edge of the Scotian Shelf. From northeast to southwest this feature is divided by
low saddles into Banquereau Bank (20-40 fathoms), Sable Island Bank (0-20
fathoms), Emerald Bank (40-60 fathoms), Lahave Bank (50-60 fathoms), and
Browns Bank (20-60 fathoms). These shelf-edge banks culminate in the low,
sandy Sable Island which stretches for about 25 miles along the outer edge of
the shelf. In profile W-7 the break from the nearly flat shelf to a gradient of 1:50
occurs at 50 fathoms; a second break occurs at 80 fathoms. A gradient of 1:10 is
reached at the 150-fathom curve. Profile W-11 is somewhat similar to W-7 in
the form of the shelf break. Profiles W-8, W-9, and W-10 show shelf breaks at
50, 60, and 70 fathoms respectively.</p>

<p>The gradient of the continental slope off the Scotian Shelf ranges from 1:10
to 1:25 along the profiles. In profiles W-7, W-8, W-10, and W-11 the 1:25
gradient abruptly decreases to 1:70 at about 700 fathoms; in W-9 the 1:25
gradient continues to almost 2000 fathoms. It is difficult to decide whether to
include the 1:40 to 1:60 segments with the continental slope or with the continental
rise. However, since we have picked the gradient of 1:40 as the minimum
gradient for true continental slopes, these segments fall within the continental
rise. The continental rise thus defined averages 160 miles in width off
the Scotian Shelf. Gradients are generally greater here than in the continental
rise farther south. The "Gully", a large submarine canyon shown on navigational
charts, lies about 25 miles east of Sable Island. The submarine canyons of the
Scotian Shelf have not been accurately mapped, but the existence of many
canyons in this area has been shown by several fathograms obtained in this
vicinity. Figure 14 illustrates one sounding profile nearly parallel to the shelf
near the "Gully". Several small canyons about 100 fathoms deep occur between
100 and 700 fathoms. Several larger canyons 300-500 fathoms deep and 7-10
miles wide are crossed on the lower continental slope and upper continental rise.</p>

<p>Profile replotted from NMC echogram runs nearly parallel to trend of continental slope

</div>

<p>Gulf of Maine Entrance.&mdash;Southwest of the Scotian Shelf there is a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
gap in the continental shelf similar to the Laurentian Channel. This feature,
called either the Northeast Trough (Shepard, 1948) or Eastern Channel of the
Gulf of Maine, is 15 miles wide and about 150 fathoms deep; it provides a deep-water
entrance to the Gulf of Maine (Fig. 13). The Gulf of Maine is enclosed
by Georges Bank off the New England shelf, Cape Cod, and southern Nova
Scotia. This entrance has recently been described by Torphy and Zeigler (1957).</p>

<p>Gulf of Maine Interior.&mdash;Much of the interior of the Gulf of Maine has been
surveyed in exceptional detail by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The reader is
referred to Murray's paper (1947) for a thorough description of the floor of the
Gulf of Maine. In general the floor is extremely irregular with several 20- to 40-fathom
"hills" per mile. The floor is covered by sediment which transmits sound
so readily that the area is noted for exceptionally pronounced sub-bottom reflections
from the rock layers beneath the sediment.</p>

<p>Northeastern United States Sector.&mdash;From the northeast tip of Georges Bank
to Cape Hatteras the continental margin is remarkably uniform in morphologic
detail. Profiles W-12 to W-19 differ very little from the type profile off northeastern
United States (Fig. 15). The continental shelf and slope in this area are
better surveyed than in any other area in the Atlantic. The surveys of the Coast
and Geodetic Survey were contoured and described by Veatch and Smith (1939).
The sediment studies of Stetson (1936; 1938; 1949) and the seismic studies of
Ewing and others (1937 <em>et seq.</em>) make this geologically the best-known shelf and
slope in the world. Many large and well-mapped canyons cut the continental slope
from Georges Bank to Cape Hatteras. The large submarine canyons off Georges
Bank have attracted great interest because of their remoteness from rivers and
associated discharges of river sediments.</p>

<p>The continental shelf is 50 to 100 miles wide in this sector. Toward Cape
Hatteras the coastal plain widens as the shelf narrows. The combined features are
called the "emerged and submerged coastal plain." The gradient of the continental
slope ranges from 1:8 to 1:15 and the base of the slope with one exception is
at 1150 &plusmn; 100 fathoms. The shelf break is at about 50 fathoms on all profiles.
On profiles W-12, W-13, W-14, W-15, W-18, and Figure 1 of Plate 4 there is
a second break at 75-100 fathoms.</p>

<p>The break between the continental slope and the upper continental rise is
abrupt at some places and occupies a distance of 5 to 10 miles in other places
(Fig. 16). In each case the gradient of the next lower 30- to 50-mile segment is
1:100.</p>

<p>All profiles from Georges Bank to Cape Hatteras, a span of more than 500
miles, show both an upper and a lower continental rise (Profiles W-13, W-19,
and Fig. 15). The uniformity in the continental slope gradient carries over into
the continental rise. Both the upper continental rise and the lower continental
rise are divided into three segments. The width, gradient, and depths of each of
the slope segments are remarkably similar. Representative values based on profiles
W-13 to W-19 and Figure 15 are shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>The upper continental rise and the lower continental rise are essentially terrace
or shelflike features. Each has a relatively steep (1:50-1:200) outer face (segment
3) and a relatively gentle (1:250-1:2000) shelflike surface (segment 2).
In each case a slope of intermediate gradient (1:80-1:300) (segment 1) connects
the upper shelflike surface with the next higher face. In the case of the
upper continental rise the next higher face is the continental slope. Other smaller-scale
terracelike features may eventually be correlated along the strike when more
data are available. The local relief exceeds 20 fathoms in the deeper parts of segment
3 of the lower continental rise. A range of hills extends for a few
hundred miles along the base of the continental rise as indicated on the physiographic
province chart (Pl. 20). These hills, known as the lower continental rise
hills, are 30-100 fathoms high and each is 1 to 3 miles wide. An echogram (Pl.
3, fig. 4) shows three continental rise hills. The only other part of the continental
rise where relief of more than 20 fathoms is generally encountered is in segment
1 of the upper continental rise. The irregularity in this case is probably related
to the extensions of numerous continental-slope canyons onto the continental rise.
Relief of 5-10 fathoms is almost universal in segments 1 and 2 of the upper continental
rise. The echogram reproduced in Figure 1 of Plate 3 shows typical
minor-relief features of the upper continental rise. An oblique crossing of a submarine
canyon on the upper continental rise is shown in Figure 2 of Plate 3. The
smooth topography typical of most of the remainder of the continental rise is well
illustrated by the echogram shown in Figure 3 of Plate 3.</p>

<p>The Hudson Submarine Canyon cuts across the continental rise in this sector.
A chart contoured by Ivan Tolstoy and the authors from surveys made in 1949
is shown in Plate 2 (Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1951). A series of 30 cross
profiles is shown in Figure 17.</p>

<p>The Hudson Canyon, which is more than 500 fathoms deep and 5 miles wide
in the continental slope (Upper Gorge), narrows to less than 2 miles and shallows
to 50 fathoms at the base of the continental slope. As it cuts across segment 2 of
the upper continental rise the canyon gradually deepens. When it cuts into the
upper part of segment 3 the canyon deepens to 300 + fathoms, widens to 3 +
miles, and forms the Lower Gorge. The canyon gradually narrows and shallows as
it cuts across the lower continental rise. It ends near Caryn Peak where sediment
cores indicate an extensive delta or submarine alluvial cone. The upper continen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>tal
rise and the lower continental rise can be tentatively traced northeastward
through the Scotian Shelf and Grand Banks sectors. The irregular bench at
2250-2450 fathoms on W-6 and the bench at 2300 fathoms on W-8 and W-11
can probably be referred to segment 2 of the lower continental rise.</p>

<p>Near Cape Hatteras the entire character of the continental margin changes.
Benches which were barely discernible farther north widen to form a series of
broad steps which resemble a giant staircase descending to the depths of the
Atlantic. These benches appear to merge with the benches of the Blake Plateau
and Escarpment farther south. However, insufficient profiles exist to permit a
firm correlation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Blake Plateau Sector.&mdash;This sector is divided into two parts, the northern
part from Cape Hatteras to 29&deg; N. (essentially a transition zone) and the southern
or main Blake Plateau between 29&deg; N. and the northern edge of the Bahamas
at 26&deg; N.</p>

<p>The shelf break lies parallel to the coast, about 60 miles offshore, from just
south of Cape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral. The continental slope extends (at
a gradient of 1:40) only to depths of 300-400 fathoms where the lower gradients
(<em>ca.</em> 1:1000) of the Blake Plateau are found.</p>

<p>The main or southern Blake Plateau is 170 miles wide (east-west) and extends
from the latitude of Grand Bahama Island to 30&deg; N. From this point to
Cape Hatteras the Blake Plateau narrows and disappears. The Blake Escarpment
forms a precipitous drop to abyssal depths along the eastern edge of the
plateau. The top of the Blake Escarpment lies at about 550 fathoms, and its base
at about 2600 fathoms. The Escarpment is typically formed by two or three distinct
slope segments.</p>

<p>An echogram obtained along a track running southeast from Charleston,
South Carolina, is reproduced in Figure 1 of Plate 7. The continental shelf extends
from the shore at an extremely low gradient to the 25-fathom isobath where
a small definite notch marks an increase in gradient to 1:1000. This gradient
continues to the 50-fathom isobath where it changes to 1:40. At the 90-fathom
curve the gradient increases to 1:120 and continues to 160 fathoms where it
finally increases to 1:40. This continental slope drops from 160 fathoms to 280
fathoms where the gradient flattens, and the surface changes from smooth to
rough, with hills 10 to 20 fathoms high and half a mile to 1-&frac12; miles wide. These
hills, which extend for 4-6 miles along the profile, directly underlie the Gulf
Stream.</p>

<p>For 50 miles seaward of these hills the ocean floor is irregular between 230
and 300 fathoms. At 90 miles from shore five eastward-facing scarps 10-20
fathoms high form a striking contrast to the generally smooth, gently rolling
topography. At 300 fathoms the gradient increases to 1:200, and the sea floor
drops for the next 24 miles to 400 fathoms where a few small hills are associated
with a drop in the gradient to 1:1000. Southeast of this point the bottom is
smooth until at a depth of 430 fathoms a steep scarp drops abruptly 30 fathoms
to form a mile-wide depression 20-30 fathoms deep. The southeast side of this
feature rises to 445 fathoms, and southeastward of a few 5-fathom scarps the
surface of the Blake Plateau becomes smooth.</p>

<p>The same general succession of topographic features is shown in a echogram
(Pl. 7, fig. 2) taken along a southeast-northwest line east of Daytona Beach,
Florida. The small definite notch at 26 fathoms is present, but a significant difference
between the two echograms is seen between 90 and 300 fathoms. On the
Charleston profile a steep 1:40 gradient slope marks this depth range, while,
on the Daytona Beach profile, the gradient is relatively gentle (1:180); small
but probably significant benches are found at 225, 270, 290, 375, and 385
fathoms. Both profiles have the same characteristic rugged 5- to 15-fathom hills
at 400 fathoms at a point underlying the Gulf Stream. On the Charleston profile
a broad, gently fractured arch separates the continental slope from the smooth
outer part of the Blake Plateau. The small, sharp-crested hills noted on the
Daytona Beach and Charleston profiles are also found at the north end of the
Straits of Florida (Pl. 4, fig. 2).</p>

<p>Blake Escarpment.&mdash;Profiles W-23, W-24, and W-25 and Figure 18 illustrate
the form of the Blake Escarpment. The outer edge of the Blake Plateau
abruptly breaks off at about 600 fathoms. Here gradients increase to 1:30. This
segment continues with a few minor breaks to a depth of 1200 to 1500 fathoms
where a narrow bench or at least a major break in slope occurs. Below this bench
the escarpment drops so steeply that only a few side echoes are recorded. The
gradient here exceeds 1:2 in several profiles. At 2400 fathoms there is in places
another narrow bench, but on other profiles the abyssal plain of the floor of the
Blake-Bahama Basin lies directly at the foot of the steepest segment. A peculiar
fact is that along many east-west cross sections the deepest point in the basin
lies directly at the foot of the escarpment. A similar deepening adjacent to the
Campeche and West Florida escarpments in the Gulf of Mexico has been
reported (Ewing, Ericson, Heezen, 1958).</p>

<p>Antilles Outer Ridge.&mdash;South of Cape Hatteras a ridge ranging in width from
60 to 200 miles lies about 100 miles east of the Blake Escarpment and the Bahama
Banks. The ridge has two parallel crests 100 miles apart which both plunge to the
south. At 30&deg;N. the crests average about 1600 fathoms in depth, but at 25&deg;N.
they are 2750 fathoms, a drop of nearly 1000 fathoms in 300 miles. The smooth
rolling topography of the ridge between Cape Hatteras and 24&deg;N. resembles
the continental rise off New York or, in some areas, the somewhat stronger
relief of the Bermuda Plateau of the central Bermuda Rise (Pl. 5, figs. 1, 2).</p>

<p>South of 24&deg;N. and in the vicinity of Hispaniola the ridge is poorly known
and difficult to study because of its low relief and the large errors in most nonprecision
soundings taken in such a great depth of water. North of Puerto Rico
the outer ridge appears as a clearly defined feature between the Puerto Rico
Trench on the south and the Nares Abyssal Plain on the north. Again there are
two parallel crests 60 miles apart marked by low relief of 20 to 100 fathoms
at a depth of 2750 fathoms.</p>

<p>The Antilles Outer Ridge, continuing to the east, merges with the Lower
Step of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. But more probably it skirts the Lesser Antilles
to join the continental rise off South America. The crest zone is covered by
<em>Globigerina</em> ooze in the north and red clay in the south; it is isolated from the
silty clays of the continental slope except on its northwest flank. Sub-bottom
echoes appear on fathograms taken across the outer ridge. Data suggest that a
prominent 8- to 10-fathom sub-bottom interface extends over the outer ridge
between San Salvador and 30&deg;N. (Pl. 6).</p>

<p>Bahamas Sector.&mdash;The Bahamas sector can be divided into two parts: (1)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the broad (200 miles wide) northern area dominated by broad, shallow banks
broken by relatively narrow, deep (<em>ca.</em> 1000 fathoms) tongues or channels; (2)
the narrow southeastern part where the banks decrease in area and the tongues
deepen (to 2200 fathoms) and widen. This southeastern part tapers to the east
in the direction of the Puerto Rico Trench. The southeast tip of this area is
formed by Navidad Bank, whose eastern slopes drop to the floor of the Puerto
Rico Trench.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/fig18.jpg" width="700" height="488" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure 18.</span>&mdash;<em>Tracing of PDR record of Blake Escarpment</em></p>

<p>No soundings were recorded between 1600 and 2400 fathoms, a common difficulty on this
precipitous escarpment. Note how Blake-Bahama Abyssal Plain slopes toward the base of
the escarpment.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bahama Banks appear to consist of a slab superimposed on the same
surface which forms the Blake Plateau. The Blake Escarpment merges with the
lower part of the eastern slope of the Bahamas. The slopes of the Bahamas are
precipitous; gradients are of the order of 1:4 to 1:8. Vertical cliffs, which lie just
below the 50-fathom curve, have been reported by lead soundings (Armstrong,
1953). The Tongue of the Ocean and the Northeast and Northwest Providence
channels form a network of submarine canyons (Hess, 1933). The floor of this
canyon system has a continuous down-slope gradient to the floor of the Blake-Bahama
Basin. Sediment cores from the floor of the Blake-Bahama Basin (2525
fathoms) (Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1952) contained thick (1-3 m) beds of
graded calcareous sand. The steep slopes of the Bahamas are generally rocky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and cores here reveal a variety of Tertiary and Cretaceous sediments. Exuma
Sound also is linked by submarine canyons to the Blake-Bahama Basin. The
graded calcareous sands of the Blake-Bahama Basin were probably carried
through this submarine canyon system by turbidity currents. The topographic
benches of Exuma Sound have been described by Lee (1951).</p>

<p>The southeastern Bahamas from Great Inagua to Navidad Bank consist of
more numerous isolated banks and greater expanses of ocean floor in the depth
range of 1700-2400 fathoms. The basins behind the southern Bahamas lie below
the sill depth between the line of banks. Thus an abyssal plain lies entrapped in
the Hispaniola-Caicos Channel and the southeastern portion of the Old Bahama
Channel. Profile W-29 (Pl. 24) shows much irregular relief between 1000 and
1500 fathoms.</p>

<p>Puerto Rico Trench Sector.&mdash;With the disappearance of the Bahama Banks
at the eastern edge of Navidad Bank, the continental margin assumes its third
mode of expression: the marginal trench-outer ridge complex. The outer ridge,
which nearly disappeared in the southeastern Bahama sector, again becomes a
prominent feature. The last traces of the marginal plateau merge with the continental
slope of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Trench develops
rapidly east of Navidad Bank; it lies between the outer ridge and the continental
slope or landward trench slope of the Greater Antilles. The relief of the outer
ridge is somewhat greater than that observed on the outer ridge farther northwest
near the Blake Plateau. The floor of the Puerto Rico Trench is divided into
two parts by a longitudinal ridge. The deepest parts of both are floored by
nearly level trench plains. The deeper one on the outer or northern side maintains
a nearly constant depth at 4358 fathoms (4585 fathoms corrected) for 150 miles
(Ewing and Heezen, 1955). The southern or inner trench is more variable in
depth, and the trench plain lies intermittently along its length. Its depth ranges
from 3600 to 4300 fathoms (uncorrected). The walls of the Puerto Rico Trench
are formed by a series of extremely steep segments which show a remarkable
persistence along the trench. Profiles W-32 and W-33 illustrate the typical
trench profile north of Puerto Rico. Breaks in slope are observed at 700 fathoms
and at 1500 fathoms; at 2000 fathoms the gradient steepens to &gt; 1:6. In this
region all soundings are side echoes. The outer or seaward wall of the trench
is also characterized by a succession of laterally persistent slope segments. A
bench at 3800 fathoms at the top of a scarp which drops to the bottom of the
trench is characteristic of several profiles.</p>

<p>Anegada Passage.&mdash;The Virgin Islands Bank extends 30 miles east of Puerto
Rico along the south side of the Puerto Rico Trench. Between the Virgin
Islands Bank and St. Croix a deep passage cuts through from the Atlantic to the
Caribbean. This deep passage is 130 miles long and runs along an e-ne-w-sw line.
Its walls are extremely steep (9&deg;-43&deg;) (Frassetto and Northrop, 1957). The
structure of this feature has been studied by Shurbet and Worzel (1957) and by
J. Ewing et al. (1957).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">SOUTHWESTERN EUROPE AND NORTHWEST AFRICA</span>: The continental margin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Europe and Africa is illustrated in Plate 25 by only 23 profiles, and therefore
our description of this area cannot be as detailed as that for North America. For
purposes of description we have broken the area into four sectors of contrasting
type: (1) the Anglo-French sector: (2) the Iberian sector; (3) the Gibraltar
sector; and (4) the North African sector. In all but the three profiles in the
Gibraltar sector there is a well-defined continental shelf. The continental slope is
everywhere present but ranges widely in height and gradient. The continental
rise is extremely well developed off Africa but virtually absent in the Bay of
Biscay. Abyssal plains are shown on almost every profile, but their depth ranges
from 2550 to 3075 fathoms, and their width from 50 to 250 miles.</p>

<p>Anglo French Sector.&mdash;Profiles E-1, E-2, and E-3 are representative of the
Anglo-French sector which extends from 45&deg; N. to 60&deg; N. Only the southern
part of this sector is shown on the physiographic diagram. The continental slope
is broken by a prominent bench or marginal plateau at 1000-1200 fathoms. The
northwest corner of the physiographic diagram south to 42&deg; N. is included in
Hill's (1956) contour chart. According to this chart the prominent 1200-fathom
bench extends for more than 900 miles along the continental margin from 45&deg; to
60&deg; North Latitude.</p>

<p>The continental slope from the shelf break to the prominent bench exhibits
smaller benches and changes in slope, many of which probably will be correlatable
when more profiles are obtained in this region. The general gradient of this
portion of the slope ranges from 1:10 to 1:30. On the bench individual slope
segments range from 1:40 to 1:80. Below the bench the sea floor drops from
1500 to 2100 fathoms at gradients of 1:15 to 1:30.</p>

<p>In profiles E-1 and E-3 a narrow continental rise about 70 miles wide with
gradients of 1:250 to 1:800 lies at the foot of the continental slope. This narrow
continental rise (Pl. 8, fig. 1) gives away to a 60-mile-wide abyssal plain at about
2500 fathoms depth (Pl. 8, fig. 3). Abyssal-plain gradients are about 1:2000 in
this region. Toward the southeast corner of the Bay of Biscay the 1000- to 1200-fathom
bench disappears (Fig. 16b); the continental rise and continental shelf narrow
to 30 miles. We have only two profiles off the north coast of Iberia, but Hill's
(1956) chart suggests that the slope is relatively steep with some prominent
benches, and that the continental shelf and continental rise narrow to 10 to 15
miles in width. The prominent Cape Breton Submarine Canyon lies at the southeast
corner of the Bay of Biscay (Bourcart, 1949).</p>

<p>Iberian Sector.&mdash;This sector was described by De Andrade (1937) on the
basis of a large number of discrete soundings by the Portuguese Hydrographic
Service. Relatively few echo-sounding profiles are available for the area, and
little more can be added to De Andrade's description. The shelf in most places
is less than 20 miles in width. The few echo-sounding profiles available indicate
several prominent benches on the continental slope. Exceptionally large submarine
canyons occur off Cape St. Vincent, Set&uacute;bal, Lisbon (2), and Nazar&eacute;.
Preliminary investigations by the Lamont Geological Observatory indicate that
Tertiary sediments outcrop on the walls of Lisbon and Set&uacute;bal canyons (Sutton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<em>et al.</em>, 1957). Tertiary sediments have also been obtained by dredging and cable
grappling along the continental slope of northwest Iberia (Wiseman and Ovey,
1950).</p>

<p>Gibraltar Sector.&mdash;The continental margin in this sector is unique. The straits
cut through at about 200 fathoms so that profiles through the straits show no
continental shelf. A typical abrupt continental slope is also absent since only
locally do slope segments have gradients exceeding 1:45. A series of prominent
benches is seen in the sector from profile E-7 to E-10.</p>

<p>The dominant bench levels in this sector are 300, 600, 850, 1300, 1700, and
2100 fathoms. Insufficient profiles and dredgings are available in this area to
permit the correlation and dating of these benches. Photographs in the area show
sandy and rocky bottom, and thus dredging in this area might yield rich rewards
in ancient sediments. The benches are so prominent that a detailed study of the
topography should be equally rewarding. Of particular interest is the manner in
which the broad benches in the Gibraltar area merge with the smaller benches
and breaks in slope of the steep continental slopes of Portugal and Algeria. The
topography in this sector most closely resembles that of the northern Blake
Plateau (profiles W-21, W-22) and the northern part of the Anglo-French sector.
In all these areas many benches are developed, and steep slopes are only
locally developed.</p>

<p>Northwest African Sector.&mdash;The continental margin from northwest Morocco
to Dakar is remarkably uniform and rather closely resembles the northeastern
United States sector. The continental shelf and slope are well developed
(Fig. 19). The shelf is 15 to 70 miles in width and thus is somewhat narrower
than either the North American shelf or the Anglo-French shelf. The shelf break
ranges from 50 to 80 fathoms. The continental-slope gradients range from 1:15
to 1:40 and are thus somewhat less steep than in the American sectors. Prominent
benches are common at 300, 600, 850, 1200, and 1600 fathoms. The continental
rise is well developed and is compound. The main contrast between the
North African and American sectors is the greater width of the African continental
rise. Off northeastern United States a line of isolated volcanic peaks
cuts across the continental rise and abyssal plain. In the North African continental
margin volcanic peaks are larger, more numerous, and lie in coalescing lines
or along ridges. The Cape Verde and Canary groups lie in the continental rise
near the outer edge of the upper continental rise. All provinces except the continental
shelf widen from Gibraltar southward toward Cape Verde.</p>

<p>On profile E-11 off Casablanca the distance from the shelf break to the lower
continental rise is only 50 miles as compared with a similar measurement of 500
miles at Cape Verde. Off Casablanca the continental slope extends to 1400
fathoms where the gradient drops to less than 1:40 from 1:10-1:20 on the continental
slope. The upper continental rise which widens to more than 100 miles
farther south is only poorly developed off Morocco. No other deep-sea echo-sounding
profiles are available for the Moroccan continental margin. Surveys of
the continental slope made by the French Hydrographic Service during the past
few years will, when published in full, undoubtedly provide much valuable information
on the topographic benches in this important area (Grousson, 1957).</p>

<p>Profile E-12 passes from the African coast between Fuerteventura and Gran
Canary toward the northeast. Here the continental slope extends only to 1000
fathoms. The Canary Islands rise abruptly from the continental rise. Except for
gradients of the order of 1:15 on the steep slopes of these volcanic islands the
gradients of the continental rise are 1:300-1:1000.</p>

<p>Profiles E-13 and E-14 end on the east near Gran Canary and thus do not
show most of the upper continental rise. They do show the remarkably wide and
nearly level lower continental rise which reaches a width of more than 500 miles.</p>

<p>Profiles E-15 and E-16 lie off Spanish Sahara. In both profiles the gradient
is 1:10 to 1:20 between the 50-fathom shelf break and a bench at 300-500
fathoms. In both profiles the gradient drops below 1:40 at about 1200 fathoms.
Both profiles show numerous prominent benches on the continental slope. The
upper continental rise with gradients of 1:350-1:1200 extends to the western
limit of the profiles.</p>

<p>In profiles E-17 and E-18 the continental slope becomes gentler, and only in
the upper 500 fathoms of E-18 does the gradient exceed 1:25. The upper continental
rise is about 60 miles wide with depths predominantly about 1600
fathoms, and the lower continental rise lies at about 2100 fathoms and is very
smooth.</p>

the Cape Verde Plateau which rises from the lower continental rise. The Cape
Verde Plateau consists largely of the coalescing bases of the volcanic Cape Verde
Islands. The lower continental rise and the abyssal plain reach their maximum
width at this latitude. The width of the ocean, the width of the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge, the width of the abyssal hills, and the depth at the axis of maximum depth
all reach their maximum values for the North Atlantic at this point. The characteristics
of the continental rise in this sector are listed in Table 2. The reliability
of these figures is much poorer than those given for northeastern United States,
owing to the smaller number of profiles in this sector.</p>

<p>A famous submarine canyon, the Fosse de Cayar, lies just north of Cape
Verde. Other submarine canyons are certainly present in the sector since any
profile parallel to the strike of the topography reveals large irregularities probably
related to canyons. Echograms (Pls. 9, 13) taken in the continental rise in
this sector show distinct contrasts in the topographic detail of the sea floor. The
rugged topography of the abyssal hills (Pl. 9, fig. 4) contrasts sharply with the
nearly flat, extremely smooth abyssal plain. (Pl. 9, fig. 3). The continental rise is
nowhere so smooth nor so flat as the abyssal plain. The continental rise ranges
from 10- to 20-fathom rolling hills 5-10 miles in width to 2- to 5-fathom hills a
few hundred feet across (Fig. 19). At the seaward edge of the abyssal plain the
echo sounder penetrates the bottom to reveal interfaces 5-20 fathoms below (Pl.
13, Fig. 4). Sub-bottom penetration of 5-15 fathoms is occasionally encountered
on the continental rise on local topographic highs. Lower continental-rise hills of
the type observed off eastern United States have not been observed off Africa.</p>


<h3>BENCHES AND TERRACES OF THE CONTINENTAL MARGIN</h3>

<p>The topography of the continental margin provinces is divided into a series
of benches or terraces. The largest are the continental shelf and slope (continental
terrace) and the upper and lower continental rise. Superimposed on each of
these major features is a series of smaller benches and terraces which range from
features a few miles wide to simple breaks in the gradient of the continental slope.</p>

<p>Many of these features can be traced for hundreds of miles (Heezen <em>et al.</em>,
in press); some are intermittent, others change in depth with distance along the
shelf; still others are only locally developed. We can propose at least four possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
origins for terraces or benches: (1) ancient shore features; (2) structural (or
rock) benching; (3) block faulting; and (4) landslide or slump scars.</p>

<p>The submerged terraces within a few hundred feet below present sea level
can probably best be explained as ancient beaches formed during the lower sea
levels of the Pleistocene. The fact that the same levels are found along coasts of
diverse geology and tectonic development supports the eustatic origin of terraces
between sea level and 70-100 fathoms. The gradients of the continental shelf are
so low and the benches are so persistent that block faulting and slump scars
are excluded as general explanations. The benches of the continental slope extend
to depths of 1500 fathoms and vary in depth from point to point along the continental
slope. These cannot be Pleistocene eustatic levels unless we consider that
they were formed prior to recent large crustal deformations. Again the persistence
of the benches for many miles argues against a fault-scarp or slump-scar
hypothesis. Thus, while the benches of the continental shelf are probably ancient
beaches, particularly those traced at the same depth for thousands of miles, the
benches of the continental slope are probably rock benches, while some may
represent step faulting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">SUBMERGED BEACHES ON THE CONTINENTAL SHELF</span>: In Table 3 the depths of
terraces or persistent levels of the continental shelf are listed for selected points
in the North Atlantic. There is a remarkable uniformity in these data; the same
levels are found near Newfoundland, in Florida, and on oceanic islands far from
the glaciated areas.</p>

<p>On the basis of data obtained in the North Atlantic it is not possible to date
the different terraces, but probably most were formed in the period between
12,000 and 5,000 years B.P. when the sea rose in consequence of the melting of
the Wisconsin glaciers. Coring and dredging on these submerged ancient beaches
could probably produce material datable by the radiocarbon method.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Continental Margin Benches</span>: On each profile across the continental margin
is a series of benches and changes in gradient which range from the shelf
break to slight changes in gradient on the continental slope.</p>

<p>If a field geologist enters a new area of sedimentary rocks where road cuts do
not exist he invariably goes to the stream valleys, and here he gets his first and
best view of the geologic section. The stream's gradient is adjusted to the resistance
of the rocks over which it cuts, and the form of the valley-side slopes
reveals the nature of the underlying rocks even if they are grassed over.</p>

<p>This obvious field method had never been fully applied to the continental
margin. Stetson (1936) dredged in the canyons of Georges Bank, and his hauls
included Cretaceous sandstones and Tertiary marls and green sands. He concluded
that the canyons had been cut deep into the continental margin to expose
the underlying Cretaceous rocks, but he considered the continental slope the
product of depositional processes.</p>

<p>However Upham (1894) had suggested that the continental slope formed
a continuous outcrop of Tertiary and Cretaceous sediments from Newfoundland
to Florida, a suggestion the writers consider quite probable. That is to say, an
analogy can be made between the continental slope and one face of the Grand
Canyon or to an erosional escarpment bounding a high mesa or plateau like the
Book Cliffs of Utah and Colorado.</p>

<p>Only a few areas of the world are sufficiently well sounded to provide data
for a study of structural benches. One cannot expect to see identical structural
benches in each profile even across a slope composed of a laterally uniform series
of horizontal beds of contrasting lithologies. The exact mode of erosion, the local
system of jointing, and chance variations in a number of other variables make it
necessary to have a large number of closely spaced, accurately located profiles.
We are fortunate that the Coast and Geodetic Survey has surveyed virtually the
entire continental slope from Georges Bank to Norfolk, Virginia. Almost all these
sounding lines are run at right angles to the strike of the topography and are thus
suitable for analysis of structural benches. In this same area the dredgings of
Stetson (1936) on Georges Bank and the Esso Hatteras Light test provide us
with information on the stratigraphy of the sediments which form the continental
shelf and slope. The seismic work of Ewing and collaborators (1937 <em>et seq.</em>)
provides us with further information on the dips and on the depths of a number
of sedimentary rock series of contrasting lithology.</p>

<p>Fishermen began finding fossiliferous rocks on Georges Bank well over a
century ago. They were not particularly pleased to obtain rocks instead of fish
and generally threw the accursed rocks back into the sea. Some curious fishermen
brought a few of the rocks to shore, however, and in time some of these were
received by the museums (Upham, 1894; Dahl, 1925). These rocks contain
Tertiary and Cretaceous fossils. The depths and positions of recovery of the rocks
were generally unknown to the museums, and no clear idea could be gained of
the exact occurrence of this material. Stetson (1936; 1949) conducted a series of
scientific dredging operations in the Georges Bank area. His aim was to recover
more of these older rocks from known depth ranges and positions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>He concluded that the older rocks outcrop only in the submarine canyons. He
found no consistent depth ranges for the series of Miocene and Upper Cretaceous
rocks obtained.</p>

</div>

<p>In the Georges Bank area a series of prominent benches continues along the
continental slope. If these are structural benches we should be able to trace them
up the canyons and thus determine the dip of the formations. If the benches are
the result of step faulting or landslide scars they would not extend up the canyons.
In order to test these alternatives, a series of profiles has been plotted from the
surveys of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. A line was drawn which paralleled
most of the contours of the continental slope for 20 miles or more (Fig. 20). A
second line was drawn at right angles to this first strike line. All sounding lines
in the area were projected to this second dip line along lines parallel to the strike
line, and plotted as a composite projected profile (Fig. 21). If the first line was
essentially the strike of rock layers then we should be able to determine the dip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of the beds by picking the successive benches as they occur on successive profiles
across the canyon. In Figure 21 the results of the analysis of Oceanographer and
Hydrographer canyons are presented. The dredge hauls by Stetson (1949) have
also been projected on this profile. We see that a major bench occurs at <em>A</em> which
passes below the hauls in which fossiliferous Navarro (Upper Cretaceous) was
obtained and through the upper limit of the hauls where Matawan (Upper Cretaceous)
was obtained. Thus if this horizon or one closely parallel to it is the
Navarro-Matawan contract, the apparent discrepancies of the depth ranges of
Stetson's dredge hauls are explained. Much more important to the present study
is the dating of a prominent structural bench.</p>

</div>

<p>The Esso Hatteras Light No. 1 test encountered crystalline rock at 1640
fathoms depth, beneath Lower Cretaceous strata (Spangler, 1950). The several
holes drilled in the vicinity revealed remarkably constant dips over a wide area.
This is in fact true of the whole coastal plain. Since the Hatteras well is only 17
miles from the continental slope, it seems reasonable to project the dips to the
continental slope. We can then observe whether prominent benches on the continental
slope correlate with resistant strata in the well. We find (Fig. 22) that
they do. In the area between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia several cores have
revealed reworked Eocene, Miocene, and Cretaceous Foraminifera. In 1947
Northrop and Heezen (1951) obtained a photograph and a core at 500 fathoms
on the continental slope. The core contained Eocene (Jackson) sediments, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the photograph showed a rock ledge below the marl sampled. Although sediment
cores, particularly those of reworked material, do not provide as reliable information
as dredge hauls, this outcrop of un-reworked Eocene may also be used
in dating the structural benches of the continental slope.</p>

<p>The structural benches between Cape Hatteras and Cape May are remarkably
uniform and persistent (Fig. 23). On the basis of the extrapolation shown
in Figure 22, the structural benches in this area have been correlated with the
formations encountered in the Hatteras well. North of Cape May a major angular
unconformity separates the late Tertiary and Cretaceous formations. Eocene
has not been found north of Nantucket. Upper Cretaceous has been found at
about 400 fathoms off Georges Bank (Fig. 21), and Lower Cretaceous has been
dredged at 200 fathoms off Banquereau Bank, Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>Between 1945 and 1950 workers on the <span class="smcap">Atlantis</span> made several sounding
profiles east of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Each crossed the
precipitous Blake Escarpment. It was quite clear that no sediment could be accumulating
on such a steep escarpment and that beds of ancient sediments and
perhaps crystalline rocks must outcrop on the escarpment. In 1949 and 1950 a
few cores were taken on the escarpment which encountered Miocene and Eocene
sediments in depths of 500-800 fathoms (Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1952).
The marked similarity of all topographic profiles further supported the view that
the escarpment was formed by the outcrop of an orderly sequence of horizontal
sedimentary rock layers. With this specific problem in mind a cruise was made
to the Blake-Bahama area on the research vessel <span class="smcap">Atlantis</span>, in 1951. More than
50 cores were obtained. Sediments of Recent to Upper Cretaceous age were obtained
on the Blake Escarpment and from the steep walls of the Bahama Channels
(Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1952). Seismic-refraction work by Katz and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Ewing (1955) and Nafe <em>et al.</em> (unpublished) and reflection work by Ewing and
Landisman (unpublished) have revealed that distinct seismic interfaces can be
traced into the structural benches on the Blake Escarpment. The ancient sediments
from the Blake Escarpment and the log of the Andros well allow the dating
of some of these formation contacts. At present the most prominent bench at
1200-1500 fathoms appears to mark the base of the Upper Cretaceous. Dredging
and further coring on the Blake Escarpment below 1400 fathoms is one of the
most promising projects of its type despite the great difficulties involved.</p>

</div>

<p>Seismic-refraction profiles have been made across the continental slope southwest
from the English Channel. These studies were initiated by Bullard and
Gaskell (1941) and have been most recently reported on by Day <em>et al.</em> (1956).
The seismic section of Day <em>et al.</em> (1956) (Fig. 24) suggests that the prominent
bench at 1600 fathoms and the short but steep scarp just below represent the
outcrop of the metamorphic basement on the continental slope. It is postulated
that the prominent bench at 900 fathoms may represent the base of the Mesozoic,
and the smaller bench at 300 fathoms the base of the Miocene. Tertiary
sediments have been obtained from the walls of canyons in the Bay of Biscay in
depths down to about 1500 fathoms (Bourcart and Marie, 1951). The age assignments
in Figure 24 are taken directly from Day <em>et al.</em> (1956) and have not
been confirmed by dredging on the continental slope.</p>

<p>The writers conclude that the majority of the topographic benches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
continental slope and other category II provinces are structural benches which
reflect the outcrop of resistant rock layers. This of course implies that the continental
slope is not a simple depositional feature but a structural or erosional
one. Since the structural benches are present both in the canyons and on the
un-dissected slope, the occurrence of Tertiary and Cretaceous rocks on the continental
slope cannot be explained by erosion of submarine canyons into an otherwise
depositional terrace in the manner implied by Stetson (1949).</p>

<p>The existence of such persistent benches implies that the entire width of the
category II provinces must be at most only thinly covered by recent sediments.
Since the discovery of the great importance of turbidity currents and the relatively
low slopes necessary for their occurrence, it has been a great puzzle to the
writers how sediments could be permanently deposited on the present continental
slope. The answer is simply that they are not. In addition to the turbidity currents
which provide a mechanism for the seaward transport of sediment down
the continental margin, deep-ocean currents probably sort and transport much
sediment along a course parallel to the continental slope. It has recently been
demonstrated (Swallow and Worthington, 1957) that velocities of 10-20 cm/sec
are attained by ocean currents which flow parallel to the continental slope. The
particular measurement referred to was made at 1600 fathoms on the continental
slope south of Cape Hatteras where a 17 cm/sec southward-moving current was
observed. The strong current is not a local phenomenon since it was found in the
South Atlantic by W&uuml;st (1935) and is predicted by theories of ocean circulation
(Stommel, 1957). Photographs of ripple marks on the continental slope (See for
instance Fig. 13 in Elmendorf and Heezen, 1957) had indicated high velocities,
but it was not possible to distinguish between a current and an oscillatory origin.
The total effect of slides, slumps, turbidity currents, and strong ocean-bottom
currents is the removal of most of the unconsolidated Recent sediments from the
continental slope.</p>

<p>The deposition of a series of Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments on the subsiding
margin of the continental block has produced a wedge of sedimentary rock
largely of shallow marine facies. Each successive strata laid down on the shelf was
abruptly terminated at the shelf break by the processes of erosion which continuously
or periodically clear the unconsolidated sediment from the continental
slope. Deposition on the shelf was interrupted by several marine regressions
which produced unconformities in the stratigraphic sequence. Nafe and Drake
(1957) observed that the increase of seismic velocity with depth and therefore
the increase in compaction with depth is more rapid on the continental shelf than
in the deep sea. This is probably in part the result of erosion of previously deposited
sediments and sedimentary rocks along the unconformities and in part
the result of ground-water cementation during periods of emergence.</p>

<p>Each unconformity should mark a lithologic change and consequently a
change in the resistance to erosion of the rock series. Many structural benches
may indicate surfaces of unconformity. The most recent unconformity in the
sequence lies between the surface of the emerged Wisconsin continental shelf and
the overlying post-glacial shelf sediments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The shelf break is defined as the most prominent break in slope between the
continental shelf and continental slope. The most prominent break may locally
be a Pliocene or Miocene structural bench, but elsewhere late Pleistocene or
Recent strata may form the shelf break. Rates of subsidence, erosion, and sediment
supply vary from place to place along the continental shelf, and the lack
of conformity either in depth or in age of the shelf break is thus easily explained.</p>

<p>The deeper structure of the continental margin indicates a fundamental structural
discontinuity at the base of the continental slope (category II provinces).
It would seem a small extrapolation to attribute a fault origin to the continental
slope. Although faulting may have played a large part in the earliest history of
the category II provinces, alternate periods of sedimentation and marine planation
on the continental shelf and long-continued erosion by slumps, turbidity
currents, and deep-sea currents on the continental slope, together with a general
subsidence of the area, could have alone produced the characteristic form of the
continental terrace.</p>

<p>Further work on structural benches co-ordinated with a study of ancient sediments
from dredges and cores should enable us to draw a geologic map of the
continental slope of eastern United States and Europe (Heezen <em>et al.</em>, in preparation).</p>

<p><em>Seismicity of the continental-margin provinces.</em>&mdash;Plate 29 shows the distribution
of epicenters in the North Atlantic. Except in the Puerto Rico Trench and
the adjacent Antilles Arc, earthquakes are exceedingly rare in the continental-margin
provinces of the North Atlantic. From the Bahamas through the Grand
Banks the only earthquakes reported since 1910 are two near the Laurentian
Channel. In the eastern Atlantic an earthquake belt crosses the continental margin
near Gibraltar but does not seem to be directly associated with the Atlantic
continental margins. If the continental slope in the area covered by Plate 29 is a
fault scarp, we must infer that the motion has now been arrested.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Magnetic anomalies and continental-margin provinces.</em>&mdash;The first continuously
recorded total-intensity magnetic data for the Atlantic were obtained in
1946 on a flight from Long Island, New York, to Bermuda, and return (Keller
<em>et al.</em>, 1954). The first data from a ship-towed magnetometer were obtained in
1948 (Heezen, Ewing, and Miller, 1953).</p>

<p>The initial measurements showed (1) several large (&gt; 300&#947;) anomalies on
the continental shelf, (2) a large (&gt; 500&#947;) anomaly over the continental slope,
(3) an exceptionally smooth field over the category III provinces, (4) rough
fields with 5- to 15-mile wide 100 to 200&#947; anomalies over oceanic ridges and
rises, (5) enormous anomalies (&gt; 1000&#947;) over seamounts and islands, and (6)
large anomalies (&gt; 500&#947;) over the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.</p>

<p>The large anomalies on the continental shelf were considered to indicate large
volcanic cones buried by the sediments of the continental shelf (Miller and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Ewing, 1956). The anomaly over the continental slope was considered to be the
magnetic-edge effect associated with the abrupt edge of the continental block.
The rough fields over the oceanic rises and ridges were attributed to variations
in the susceptibility of the crustal rocks, probably related to volcanic extrusions
and intrusions. The anomaly over the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was not
recognized as a general pattern until later when many measurements were made.
The major puzzle for which no explanation was readily obtained was the origin
of the smooth field over the continental rise. The smooth or quiet field has been
observed on each crossing of the category III provinces, and even such a sharp-sided
feature as the Puerto Rico Trench failed to show a magnetic anomaly
(Davidson and Miller, 1956). We can thus state that all category III provinces
are characterized by a smooth magnetic field.</p>

<p>The significance of this point is not yet clear, but it must be of major importance
to the full understanding of the continental margin.</p>

<p><em>Crustal structure and continental-margin provinces.</em>&mdash;Maurice Ewing and
his associates have made more than 1000 seismic-refraction measurements to
determine the crustal structure of continental margins. Most of the published
results pertain to the eastern continental margin of the United States (Drake
et al., in press), but much material will soon be published on the continental
margin of Sahara, Sierra Leone, Brazil, Argentina, Guiana, Spain, Morocco, the
Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. In addition extensive work has been
accomplished by Bullard, Gaskell, and Hill in the western approaches to the
English Channel. In some areas seismic, gravity, and magnetic measurements
were made along the same lines and have been subjected to an integrated analysis
(Worzel and Shurbet, 1955c).</p>

<p>In Plate 26 four profiles replotted from published sections are shown. Each
profile is plotted at 40:1 exaggeration, and depths are indicated in fathoms and
kilometers to facilitate comparison with the profiles and topographic descriptions
given elsewhere in this paper. Some stations which lie up to 100 miles from a
profile have been projected along the strike of the topography. In general each
profile indicates (1) a thick lens of sediment and sedimentary rock beneath the
continental rise; (2) a major discontinuity in crustal structure at the base of the
continental slope; and (3) a wedge of low-velocity sedimentary rocks ("unconsolidated")
overlying a lens of higher-velocity ("semi-consolidated and consolidated")
sedimentary rocks beneath the continental shelf. The basin, filled
with higher-velocity sedimentary rocks, is formed by an upturned lip of crystalline
basement rocks near the continental slope. Local variations in thickness and
velocity give rise to interesting minor configurations, but the basic structure is
nearly identical in all the sections. The main contrast is that the category III
provinces are underlain by thick sedimentary rocks in the case of the continental
rise, and successively thinner accumulations of sedimentary rock are associated
with the marginal basins and marginal trenches.</p>

<p>Since the main difference in the continental-margin sections seems to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
greatly enhanced continental-rise sedimentary section to the north as compared
with the Blake Plateau&mdash;Bahama&mdash;Puerto Rico region, it seems reasonable to conclude
that the main difference in the topography is the result of different sedimentation
rates or a different time of origin, rather than of a vastly different
structural origin. The sedimentary rock column beneath the continental rise is
truly geosynclinal in thickness. Whether this great lens of sediment and sedimentary
rock will eventually be deformed into a mountain range to form a new
addition to the continent as advocated by the accretion school or whether it will
lie forever on the sea floor is one of the great speculations of geology.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Sediment distribution and physiographic provinces of the continental margin.</em>
The recent sediments of the category I provinces are largely sands, silts, silty
lutites, and carbonates (Stetson, 1938; Shepard and Cohee, 1936; Newell, 1955).
All these sediments can be assigned to the orthoquartzite suite of Pettijohn
(1957). Judging from the ancient sediments dredged from the continental slope
and obtained by drilling, the category I provinces have been receiving orthoquartzite
sediments at least since the Cretaceous. In category II provinces Recent
sediments are either lacking or are very thin. Those Recent sediments which
temporarily remain in the province range from foraminiferal lutites, found in
such areas as the Bahamas, to silty lutites relatively poor in pelagic fossils, found
in the higher latitudes. In general category II provinces are characterized by
nondeposition or erosion.</p>

<p>The sediments of the category III provinces include both pelagic and clastic
terrigenous sediments. The outer ridge is covered by <em>Globigerina</em> ooze in depths
shallower than about 2200 fathoms and by red clay in deeper areas. The continental
rise is generally covered by silty foraminiferal lutites, but, where submarine
canyon deltas spread out from the mouths of submarine canyons (Ericson
<em>et al.</em>, 1951, 1952), beds of graded sand and silts from a few centimeters to a few
meters in thickness are interbedded with lutites. In the marginal trenches and
marginal basins graded calcareous sands alternate with low-carbonate lutites. The
category III provinces of northwest Africa are dominated by two groups of
volcanic islands and seamounts which contribute flows and volcanic detritus to
the continental-rise sediments. In general the category III provinces are dominated
by sediments ascribable to the graywacke suite of Pettijohn (1957).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Past, present, and future of continental-margin physiographic provinces.</em>&mdash;It
takes only a little imagination to see a historical or genetic sequence in the
four profiles of Plate 26. The Puerto Rico Trench&mdash;outer-ridge profiles thus may
represent a continental margin in youth, the Blake&mdash;Bahama&mdash;outer-ridge profile a
margin in late youth or early maturity, and Newfoundland and northeast United
States profiles a margin in late maturity or old age.</p>

<p>The lens of sediments that has filled the marginal trench off northeastern
United States is truly geosynclinal in thickness (Drake <em>et al.</em>, in press). The
sediments of the shelf lens are similar in lithology to the orthoquartzite suite of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
mio-geosyncline (cf. Kay, 1951), and the thicker continental-rise lens is probably
similar in lithology to the graywacke-volcanic suite of a eugeosyncline. (Kay,
1951). It seems virtually certain that ancient orthogeosynclines were, before deformation,
closely analogous to the continental margins. The major problem is
completing the sequence from filled geosyncline to folded mountains is the mechanism
by which the earth's crust beneath the geosyncline thickens by 20-30 km.
Although we cannot predict the future of the present continental margin with
any assurance until the mechanism of thickening is understood, it seems probable
that before deformation the older orthogeosynclines were similar in most details
to the modern continental margins.</p>

<p>It seems possible that the present continental margins will in some future
geological period be uplifted into folded mountains.</p>

<h2>OCEAN-BASIN FLOOR</h2>


<h3>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>The second of the three basic topographic divisions of the oceanic depression
is the ocean-basin floor. Included in this division are those provinces of the
oceanic depression that are not included in the continental margin or the mid-oceanic
ridge.</p>

<p>The ocean-basin floor is divided into three categories: (1) abyssal floor, (2)
oceanic rises, and (3) seamounts and seamount groups. The first category includes
two types of provinces, abyssal plains and abyssal hills, which occupy the
deepest portion of the ocean-basin floor. Included in these provinces are such
features as abyssal gaps and mid-ocean canyons. The second category includes
the larger positive features of the ocean-basin floor, and the large seamounts and
seamount groups fall in the third category. The landward limit of the ocean-basin
floor is the 1:1000 gradient isopleth along the continental margin. Along the
mid-oceanic ridge the boundary is taken as that scarp or scarp zone where the
average level rises appreciably above the axis of maximum depth of the basin
floor. Broad elevations which rise above the basin floor as isolated rises are
termed oceanic rises and are included in this discussion even though they may be
structurally more closely related to the mid-oceanic ridge or the continental
margin.</p>


<h3>ABYSSAL PLAINS</h3>

<p><em>General discussion.</em>&mdash;An abyssal plain has been defined (Heezen, Ewing, and
Ericson, 1954) as "an area of the deep-ocean floor in which the ocean bottom
is flat and the slope of the bottom is less than 1:1000".</p>

<p>Abyssal plains have been found in all oceans, characteristically at the foot of
the continental rise. Koczy (1954; 1956) and Gaskell and Ashton (1954) have
described the abyssal plain south of the Bay of Bengal. Koczy (1956) has described
plains in the equatorial Atlantic on either side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
On Expedition Deep Freeze workers on the <span class="smcap">USS Glacier</span>, using a PDR, discovered
an abyssal plain in the Weddell Sea. Workers on the <span class="smcap">R. V. Vema</span> in
1957 confirmed the existence of abyssal plains in the Argentine and in the Cape
and Angola basins of the South Atlantic. Menard (1955) has described abyssal
plains off the California and Alaska coasts. Abyssal plains are really important
and are present off all coasts except those having a long, continuous, unfilled
marginal trench.</p>

<p>The abyssal plains shown on the physiographic diagram have been named in
order to facilitate referencing. The abyssal plains of the western Atlantic between
Newfoundland and the West Indies are best known. The "abyssal plain south of
Newfoundland" (Heezen <em>et al.</em>, 1954) has been named the Sohm Abyssal Plain
following the usage of Murray (1912) who referred to this area as "Sohm Deep"
in several publications. The abyssal plain south of the Bermuda Rise referred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
as the "abyssal plain in the Nares Basin" (Heezen, Ewing, and Menzies, 1955;
Luskin et al., 1954) is named on the province chart (Pl. 20) the Nares Abyssal
Plain, also following the usage of Murray (1912), who named this area the
Nares Deep. The abyssal plain southwest of the Bermuda Rise was included in
the Nares Abyssal Plain until the discovery in 1955 that the two parts were separated
by a steep abyssal gap at 24&deg; N. 68&deg; W. necessitated the splitting off of this
plain from the Nares Abyssal Plain. The name Hatteras Abyssal Plain used on
the map was suggested by the close proximity of the very prominent Cape Hatteras.</p>

<p>An abyssal plain is probably present in the Newfoundland basin, but no PDR
soundings have been obtained in that area. The name Newfoundland Abyssal
Plain is suggested subject to confirmation by a precision survey.</p>

<p>The outer ridge which runs south from Cape Hatteras paralleling the coast
lines of the Bahamas encloses the Blake-Bahama Basin (Ericson, Ewing, and
Heezen, 1952); a narrow abyssal plain is found along its western margin. This
plain is named the Blake-Bahama Abyssal Plain.</p>

<p>Between the Greater Antilles and the Bahama Banks is a depression called
the Old Bahama Channel in the north; farther south it is known as the Hispaniola-Caicos
Channel. The Hispaniola-Caicos Channel in particular contains
an abyssal plain which, although much smaller than the large, deep-sea abyssal
plains, has all the characteristics of slope flatness and sediment composition. This
is called the Hispaniola-Caicos Abyssal Plain.</p>

<p>The smallest, yet perhaps the most striking, Atlantic abyssal plains are those
at the bottom of the Puerto Rico Trench at depths of about 4358 fathoms (4585
corrected). They exhibit the proper degree of flatness, low gradient (Ewing and
Heezen, 1955), and the shallow-water clastic sediments typical of abyssal plains.</p>

<p>South of Cuba in the southwest corner of the diagram lies a major deep-sea
trench. Only the eastern end of this Cayman Trench is shown in the diagram. On
the floor of this steep-walled trench lies a narrow trench plain or system of semi-connected
trench plains which lie at depths of about 3000 fathoms south of Guantanamo,
Cuba, but deepen to 3692 fathoms south of the Cayman Islands. These
are known as the Cayman Trench Plains. This area will be described in more
detail in a later publication devoted to the topography of the Caribbean.</p>

<p>In the eastern Atlantic each abyssal plain has been crossed at least three times
by ships employing a PDR, a coverage which, although sufficient to establish
their existence, is vastly inferior to the coverage of the western Atlantic abyssal
plains. The Biscay Abyssal Plain occupies a large portion of the Bay of Biscay.
It is connected by an abyssal gap at 43&deg; 30&acute;N., 12&deg; 00&acute;W., to the Iberia Abyssal
Plain which lies west of the northern two-thirds of the Iberian Peninsula. A
small abyssal plain west of the Tagus River takes its name from this river. The
great abyssal plain which skirts Madeira on the east and south and extends over
a vast area to the west is referred to as the Madeira Abyssal Plain. The Canary
Islands and associated banks form the boundaries of a small oval depression
known as the Canary Abyssal Plain. The vast abyssal plain which skirts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
African continent west of Cape Verde is named the Cape Verde Abyssal Plain.</p>

<p>The eastern margin of the map just reaches the abyssal plain in the western
Mediterranean which Heezen and Ewing (1955) have named the Balearic
Abyssal Plain.</p>

<p>Abyssal plains were not discovered until the use of continuously recording
echo sounders was extended to abyssal depths following World War II (Tolstoy
and Ewing, 1949). While the early nonprecision echo sounders were sometimes
adequate to distinguish the limits of particular plains, real advances in their
study required the development of precision sounders and the extensive use
thereof (Heezen, Ewing, and Ericson, 1954). Since the very existence of abyssal
plains has been known for less than 10 years and only recently have any of them
been adequately delineated, the problem of their nomenclature has never before
arisen.</p>

<p>In the cases of the Nares and Sohm abyssal plains we have taken the name
Murray has given to the "deeps" in which the plains occur. For Cape Verde,
Iberia, and Newfoundland abyssal plains we have followed the name W&uuml;st
(1940b) proposed for the basin within which the plains lie. The Biscay, Tagus,
Hatteras, Blake-Bahama, Hispaniola-Caicos, and Balearic have been given the
name of a prominent near-by land area, in accordance with recognized practice.
The Horseshoe Abyssal Plain takes its name from the horseshoe-shaped line of
seamounts which surrounds it except on the eastern side.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Regional description.</em>&mdash;The relief of the abyssal plains is so low that ordinary
small-scale exaggerated profiles (Pls. 22, 27) reveal nothing of its detailed character.
In a few areas exceptionally good PDR records have been obtained which
show relief of a few feet (Pl. 12).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">SOHM ABYSSAL PLAIN:</span> The best-studied abyssal plain is the Sohm Abyssal
Plain south of Newfoundland. In addition to the 1953 <span class="smcap">Vema</span> PDR survey (Heezen
<em>et al.</em>, 1954) the area was studied extensively in 1955 and crossed by the
trans-Atlantic cruises of 1954 and 1956. The plain is T-shaped and generally
about 200 miles wide; depths range from 2700 to 3000 fathoms (uncorrected).
The depth increases in each arm of the T toward the stem where the slope
changes to south. The greatest depth is found at the south boundary of the plain
near 29&deg; N. In the northern part of the plain small topographic irregularities are
unknown, but toward the south peaks 50 to 500 fathoms high increase in number
until they finally replace the plain. North of the Bermuda Rise the plain surrounds
a line of huge seamounts. However, even here no small hills are found.
In the strip extending between 30&deg; and 37&deg; N., the east and west boundaries of
the plain are formed by scarps 200 to 800 fathoms high. The boundary on the
north side of the Bermuda Rise is formed by a distinct shallowing, but no scarp
is seen.</p>

<p>There is some justification for separating the northwest arm of the Sohm
Abyssal Plain north of the Bermuda Rise from the rest of the Sohm Abyssal
Plain since a mid-ocean canyon runs from the northwest to the central sections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of the plain. A sill might lie northeast of the northeast tip of the Bermuda Rise.
Here the bottom gradient changes slightly, and an extremely large magnetic
anomaly is associated with the region. However, the plain narrows only slightly
at this point, and, since we cannot tell how many individual basins were filled to
form an abyssal plain, we will consider that the Sohm Plain now includes the
whole area, keeping in mind that the northwest arm may have only recently
merged with the rest.</p>

<p>South of Newfoundland the continental rise merges with the abyssal plain
with no scarp or line of hills. Here the boundary is taken at the point where the
gradient is gentler than 1:1000. This is not an entirely arbitrary definition since
an appreciable change in gradient generally occurs near this point. South of the
boundary the gradient gradually decreases to 1:3000 at 37&deg; N., beyond which it
decreases even more gradually and reaches 1:5000 at the southern edge of the
plain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">HATTERAS ABYSSAL PLAIN</span>: Northeast of the Bermuda Rise on a line between
Long Island (N. Y.) and Bermuda a small area of abyssal hills lies between the
continental rise on the northwest, the Bermuda Rise on the southeast, the Sohm
Abyssal Plain on the northeast, and the Hatteras Abyssal Plain on the southwest.
Although this area has been traversed by more tracks than any area of
similar size in the Atlantic, the relationships here are still somewhat obscure.
This area of some 6000 square miles is one of irregular relief, but it is not known
if it is of the character of an irregular sill or a complex abyssal gap, although the
latter seems more probable. The northwest margin of the Hatteras Abyssal Plain
is abruptly formed by the lower continental rise hills. The eastern boundary
is generally distinct and in places is formed by a 50- or 100-fathom scarp, but
generally it is not so impressive as the east and west boundaries of the Sohm
Abyssal Plain. South of about 34&deg; N., the western boundary of the Hatteras
Abyssal Plain is formed by the outer ridge. In some sectors the eastern flank of
the outer ridge is rather gentle, and the abyssal plain gently laps the ridge without
a sharp break. This boundary is generally sharp north of 27&deg; N. but to the
south is less definite. The Hatteras Plain slopes southeast to about 31&deg; N. where
the direction of slope changes to south. A gradient of about 1:3000 and depths
of about 2900 fathoms are reached at 25&deg; N. Within about 60 miles of Vema Gap
the plain is broken by numerous mid-ocean canyons which converge on the gap
(Pl. 14, fig. 3). The Hatteras Abyssal Plain has no known seamounts or sea
knolls, in contrast to the Sohm Abyssal Plain and Nares Abyssal Plain.</p>

<p>The sediments of the Hatteras Abyssal Plain resemble the northern abyssal
plains in having many beds of quartz silts (Pl. 28) and contrast sharply with the
Blake-Bahama Abyssal Plain where calcareous sands are abundant. On the west
the outer ridge forms a continuous barrier to turbidity-current sediments coming
from the near-by Bahamas so that the only source of turbidity-current sediments
is from the Cape Hatteras region to the north or possibly from the Hudson Canyon
via the suspected abyssal gap mentioned above. The type of sediment is
entirely consistent with the gradient of the plain which slopes southward from
the Hatteras region.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLAKE-BAHAMA ABYSSAL PLAIN</span>: The Blake-Bahama Basin is a long narrow
basin between the great Blake Escarpment and calcareous Bahama Island banks
on the west and the outer ridge on the east. A narrow abyssal plain 20 to 70
miles wide spreads out from the base of the escarpment (Pl. 5, fig. 3). The plain
is shallowest and widest just east of the Northeast Providence Channel and
deepens and narrows toward its northern and southern ends. Sediment cores
taken 60 miles off the mouth of Northeast Providence Channel contained graded
beds of calcareous sand a few meters thick (Ericson <em>et al.</em>, 1952). The material
was obviously derived from the Bahamas, presumably through the action of turbidity
currents running out through the Providence Channels, the southern entrance
of Exuma Sound, and the numerous submarine canyons which dissect the
slopes off the islands. The depth of the plain ranges from 2600 to 2750 fathoms,
and its area is about 7000 square miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">NARES ABYSSAL PLAIN</span>: South and southeast of the Bermuda Rise lies the
Nares Plain, a 37,000-square-mile abyssal plain that slopes eastward from Vema
Gap toward the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. From 62&deg; to 64&deg; W. its northern and southern
boundaries are abrupt, and only three or four small abyssal hills have been
observed in the plain. East of 64&deg; W. the gradient of the plain exceeds 1:2500,
and the frequency of hills increases until at 61&deg; W. the plain consists of a series
of fingers which extend into the abyssal hills. The sediment cores obtained in
the Nares Abyssal Plain consist of alternating red clays and quartz silts (Ericson
<em>et al.</em>, 1952; in press). The Nares Abyssal Plain is the deepest of the broad
abyssal plains of the ocean-basin floor. It is also the farthest from the land. If
the turbidity currents smoothed the Nares Plain they would all have had to flow
through Vema Gap since the outer ridge-trench complex to the south prevents
currents from this area from reaching the Nares Abyssal Plain. The idea of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>route through Vema Gap is supported by the fact that the plain slopes eastward
from the gap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">HISPANIOLA-CAICOS ABYSSAL PLAIN</span>: The depression between the Bahamas
and the coasts of Cuba and Hispaniola deepens east of Cay Lobos and reaches
its maximum depth of 2220 fathoms northwest of Cape Francis Viejo of Hispaniola.
At Cay Lobos the channel is a steep V-shaped depression with a maximum
depth of 400 fathoms, but to the east this V-shaped channel opens out to an
abyssal plain about 1500 fathoms deep. Between this point and Great Inagua
Island the flat floor slopes east reaching a depth of 1575 fathoms just southwest
of Inagua. This portion is called the Old Bahama Abyssal Plain. South of Great
Inagua is another V-shaped channel in which the depth drops from 1700 fathoms
on the west to 2200 fathoms on the east. From this point to Cape Francis Viejo
the Hispaniola-Caicos Abyssal Plain is nearly flat. Sediments collected from this
plain confirmed the turbidity-current origin of the smooth topography. The cores
contained plant debris, shallow-water fossils, and a variety of reworked older
material (Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1952; Ewing and Heezen, 1955; Ericson
<em>et al.</em>, 1955).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">PUERTO RICO TRENCH (ABYSSAL) PLAINS</span>: A trench plain is an abyssal plain in
the bottom of a deep-sea trench. Since the discovery of the Puerto Rico Trench
(Abyssal) Plains similar features have been reported for the Middle America
Trench (Fisher, 1954), the Kurile-Kamchatka Trench (Udintsev, 1955), and
the Peru-Chile Trench (Zeigler, 1958). Two trench plains are known from the
Puerto Rico Trench. The smaller one occupies a basin south of a median ridge,
and the larger one lies along the deep axis of the trench. They range in width
from 1-2 miles to about 12 miles. Sediment cores taken in the trench plain contained
beds of graded calcareous sand containing fragments of <em>Halimeda</em>
and shallow benthic Foraminifera (Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1952). The
depth of the larger trench plain ranges only slightly from 4358 fathoms (4585
fathoms corrected). The trench shallows eastward, and the plains disappear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">CAYMAN TRENCH (ABYSSAL) PLAINS</span>: The Cayman Trench contains trench
plains very similar to those in the Puerto Rico Trench. The limits of the Cayman
Trench Plains shown on the physiographic diagram may not be too reliable; it
has not been redrafted since the most recent tracks shown on the track chart were
obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BISCAY ABYSSAL PLAIN</span>: The Bay of Biscay is occupied by a large abyssal
plain which begins a few miles north of the northern limit of the map and ends
at the Theta Gap at 43&deg; 30&acute;N. The plain ranges from 2550 to 2650 fathoms in
depth and is about 200 miles wide. Cores of graded sand and silt have been obtained
from the floor of the plain. Several mid-ocean canyons 3 to 5 fathoms deep
and a quarter of a mile to 2 miles wide have been observed in the plain (Pl. 8),
but data are not sufficient to determine their exact courses. It is suggested that
they converge on Theta Gap and that some may be extensions of submarine canyons
of the continental slope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">IBERIA ABYSSAL PLAIN</span>: South of Theta Gap and west of the northern third
of the Iberian Peninsula lies an oval abyssal plain of about 25,000 square miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
The depth of this plain ranges from 2770 fathoms near Theta Gap and at the
base of the continental rise to 2820 fathoms near the eastern margin of the abyssal
hills province. The plain fans out from Theta Gap and gradually merges with
the normal westward slope from the continental rise of north Iberia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">TAGUS ABYSSAL PLAIN</span>: West of the canyons off the mouth of the Tagus lies
a small circular plain of 7100 square miles. Its depth ranges from 2650 to 2700
fathoms, and it slopes westward with slightly fan-shaped contours extending
from the mouths of the two large canyons. A recent sediment sampling campaign
revealed numerous graded silt and sand layers in the plain (Pl. 28).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">HORSESHOE ABYSSAL PLAIN</span>: A small abyssal plain of 5200 square miles lies
in the center of a horseshoe-shaped ring of seamounts, just west of Gibraltar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MADEIRA AND CAPE VERDE ABYSSAL PLAINS</span>: From Gibraltar to Cape Verde
and extending southward to the Sierra Leone Rise at 10&deg; N. a vast abyssal plain
parallels the coast of Africa. For most of its length the western boundary of this
plain is 750 miles from the coast. The average width of the plain is 200 miles,
and it occasionally reaches 300 miles. An eastward extension of the abyssal hills
approaches within 200 miles of the Canary Islands, forming a natural constriction
which divides the plain into a northern part, the Madeira Abyssal Plain, and a
southern part, the Cape Verde Abyssal Plain.</p>

<p>The Madeira Abyssal Plain occupies 150,000 square miles. The Azores-Gibraltar
Ridge forms its northern boundary, and the abyssal hills its western
boundary. Depths near the seaward limit of the plain reach 2970 fathoms. The
northern part of the Madeira Plain is broken by a series of low scarps (Pl. 13,
fig. 3). The gradient of the plain between successive scarps is about 1:1500.</p>

<p>The Cape Verde Abyssal Plain occupies 200,000 square miles of sea floor
(Pl. 9, fig. 3). The transition from abyssal plain to abyssal hills is gradual. Many
hills are scattered in the plain near the boundary. Small scarps of the kind observed
in the Madeira Abyssal Plain have not been found.</p>

<p>Recent soundings southwest of Madeira indicate that a low topographic feature
which might be called the Madeira Rise continues into the northeast part
of the area shown as Madeira Abyssal Plain. This abyssal plain is thus somewhat
smaller than indicated in the drawings. Two PDR records from this rise area
are illustrated (Pl. 13, figs. 1, 2). Since the limits of the Madeira Abyssal Plain
are based on only four sounding profiles, future surveys will cause relatively
great changes in this portion of the diagram.</p>


<h3>ABYSSAL HILLS</h3>

<p><em>Definition and distribution.</em>&mdash;An abyssal hill is a small hill that rises from
the ocean-basin floor and is from a few fathoms to a few hundred fathoms in
height and from a few hundred feet to a few miles in width. The term abyssal
hills province is applied to those areas of the ocean-basin floor in which nearly
the entire area is occupied by hills&mdash;that is, the province lies at approximately the
depth of the adjacent abyssal plain but lacks a smooth floor. Isolated abyssal hills
and groups of abyssal hills also occur in the abyssal plains.</p>

</div>

<p>Abyssal hills are found along the seaward margin of most abyssal plains and
probably occur in profusion in basins isolated from adjacent land areas by ridges,
rises, or trenches. In the North Atlantic the abyssal hills form two strips parallel
to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge for virtually its entire length. The Bermuda Rise is
bordered on the southeast by abyssal hills which join with the strips adjoining
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Fig. 25). Southeast of the Bermuda Rise the abyssal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
plain is absent, and consequently the Western Atlantic Abyssal-Hills Province
exceeds 500 miles in width.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/fig27.jpg" width="700" height="393" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure 27.</span>&mdash;<em>Eight profiles, Eastern Atlantic Abyssal Hills Province</em></p>

<p>Vertical exaggeration 40:1; positions shown on Figure 25.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the North Atlantic the axes of maximum depth on the eastern and on the
western sides of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge lie in the abyssal-hills province. This
pattern probably continues through the South Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and South
Pacific oceans. Individual abyssal hills are identical to the smaller hills which
rise from the steps of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and are probably of the same origin.
The abyssal hills and the Lower Step of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge can be distinguished
topographically only by the contrast in level.</p>

<p><em>Regional description.</em>&mdash;The abyssal hills within the area of the physiographic
diagram are illustrated by profiles WH-1-11 and EH-1-8 reproduced in Figures
26 and 27 respectively.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">WESTERN ATLANTIC</span>: The abyssal-hills province ranges from a few miles to
more than 125 miles in width from the north edge of the map to the Southeast
Newfoundland Ridge. Along profile WH-1 the province consists of about a
dozen hills 3-4 miles wide and 50-100 fathoms high, while in WH-2 the hills
are 4-10 miles in width, and some exceed 200 fathoms in height. The abyssal-hills
province appears to pinch out at the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge. Southwest
of the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge the abyssal hills form a belt 60-120
miles wide which skirts along the north edge of Corner Rise. In this area, as
illustrated by WH-3, -4, and -5, the largest abyssal hills nowhere exceed 250
fathoms in height. The individual hills range from 3 to 12 miles wide; maximum
depths between individual hills frequently exceed the depth of the adjacent
abyssal plain by 50-100 fathoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Along the northwest corner of Corner Rise the abyssal-hills province pinches
out. South of Corner Rise the province appears on both the east and the west
sides of the Sohm Abyssal Plain, and isolated abyssal hills become more numerous
within the abyssal plain. In profile WH-6 the abyssal hills within the province
reach 300 fathoms in height and are 3-5 miles wide. A few higher peaks
occur such as the two in profile WH-6, one 500 fathoms high and 20 miles
wide and the other 700 fathoms high and 15 miles wide. In addition eight isolated
hills 100 to 175 fathoms high rise from the plain in the same profile. To the
south, the frequency of hills within the plain increases, and the hills province
widens. In profile WH-7 the province increases to 35 miles in width on the east
side of the Sohm Plain and to 100 miles in width on the west side. The smaller
individual hills in the plain are 200 fathoms high, in contrast to the average of
100 fathoms in WH-6. Twenty-one individual hills rise from the plain in WH-7,
in contrast to 15 in WH-6. In WH-8 the abyssal plain is represented by a flat-floored
valley only 12 miles wide; the remaining 500-mile width of the abyssal
floor is occupied by abyssal hills. Individual hills are 300 to 600 fathoms high
and 5 to 10 miles wide (Fig. 28; Pl. 10). If we filled all the depressions on
WH-8 with 100 fathoms of sediments the profile would closely resemble WH-7.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/fig28.jpg" width="700" height="573" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure 28.</span>&mdash;<em>Tracing of PDR record, abyssal hills, southeast of Bermuda Rise</em></p></div>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
WH-9 and WH-10 are very similar to WH-8 except that individual hills seem
to become broader and lower toward the south. The height of individual hills in
WH-10 ranges from 100 to 250 fathoms. South of WH-8 the abyssal-hill province
splits into two strips which border the Nares Abyssal Plain. The western
strip lies below the eastern scarp of the Bermuda Rise Scarp Zone, and the eastern
strip follows the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, sending a narrow strip westward along
the northern edge of the outer ridge north of Puerto Rico. A number of hills 50
fathoms high and 2-5 miles wide are scattered over the eastern part of the Nares
Abyssal Plain. Abyssal hills are rare in the abyssal plain west of 65&deg; W. The
abyssal-hill province along the southwestern Bermuda Rise is extremely narrow
and intermittent. No abyssal hills have been recorded for the Hatteras Abyssal
Plain, and only locally is the province developed along the western side of the
Bermuda Rise. Locally abyssal hills are moderately well developed along the
northern margin of the Bermuda Rise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">EASTERN ATLANTIC</span>: The abyssal floor west of the Anglo-French shelf is
extremely narrow; the abyssal plain and abyssal hills combined are only 80 miles
wide. The abyssal-hills province is absent, but, as shown on EH-1 and EH-2
(Fig. 27), large hills rise from the seaward edge of the Biscay Abyssal Plain.
These hills are 5-10 miles wide and 100-400 fathoms high. West of the Iberia
Abyssal Plain (EH-3) the abyssal-hills province is wider and better developed
than near the Biscay Abyssal Plain.</p>

<p>South of Gibraltar the abyssal floor widens southward; northwest of Cape
Verde it is more than 200 miles wide. Profile EH-6 runs obliquely through the
province and indicates an exaggerated width for the province. Individual hills
are 5-10 miles wide and 100-600 fathoms high (Pl. 9, fig. 4). The abyssal-hills
province is widest, and the hills are the highest where the depth is greatest, a
relation similar to that observed on the opposite side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
in the sector southeast of the Bermuda Rise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Origin of abyssal-hills topography.</em>&mdash;The topography of the abyssal hills is
considered to represent the original surface buried beneath the abyssal plains and
perhaps beneath the continental rise. This explanation agrees well with the
smooth topography and the distribution of deep-sea sands in the abyssal plain.
The origin of the hills topography is a more difficult problem. We have no rock
samples from these provinces. Individual hills cannot be studied with present seismic-refraction
techniques; they do not seem to have a characteristic magnetic
anomaly; and Worzel has only recently developed a method of gravity measurement
which can be applied to a feature as small as an abyssal hill. At present we
have only topography as a basis of speculation of their origin. As far as we know,
individual abyssal hills are not discernibly different from the smaller hills of the
steps of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge or much of the topography of the oceanic rises,
and thus there is no reason to assume that the abyssal hills have a different origin.</p>

<p>We have noted that abyssal hills range from 50 to 600 fathoms in height
and with some exceptions from 4 to 10 miles in width. However, many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
hills are about 200 fathoms high and 5 miles wide. The hills are very steep-sided,
and frequently the sounder simply records a series of "highlights" from a succession
of peaks (Pl. 10; Pl. 9, fig. 4). Soundings are difficult to obtain in the
abyssal-hills provinces because of the great depth and primarily the preponderance
of steep slopes (Pl. 10). We do not know whether individual hills
are conical or elongate or, in fact, if they run in narrow, sinuous ridges as suggested
by Tolstoy (1951). Accurate, detailed mapping of portions of the abyssal-hills
provinces on scales of approximately 1:20,000 or larger should provide additional
limits on theories of origin. At present we cannot decide among vulcanism,
faulting, or folding, although folding seems the least probable.</p>


<h3>OTHER MAJOR FEATURES OF THE ABYSSAL FLOOR</h3>

<p><em>Abyssal gaps.</em>&mdash;If two adjacent but distinct abyssal plains have no through
passage at or below the level of the higher plain, they are said to be separated by
a sill, a ridge, or a rise, depending on the dimensions of the feature involved.
However, several plains are connected by constricted passages.</p>

<p>An abyssal gap is a constricted passage connecting two abyssal plains which,
in the vicinity of the gap, lie at different levels. The sea floor slopes down continuously
through the gap from the higher to the lower abyssal plain, at a gradient
considerably greater than that of either adjacent abyssal plain.</p>

<p>Prominent abyssal gaps are known in the western North Atlantic (Vema
Gap) and in the eastern North Atlantic (Theta Gap). An abyssal gap connects
the Colombia and Venezuela abyssal plains of the Caribbean.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Mid-ocean canyons.</em>&mdash;Whereas most submarine canyons are furrows cut into
the continental-margin provinces, a class of canyon is found in the abyssal plains,
generally associated with abyssal gaps.</p>

<p>A mid-ocean canyon is a steep-walled, flat-floored persistent linear depression,
1-5 miles wide and a few to more than 100 fathoms deep, which occurs in
an abyssal plain.</p>

<p>Each mid-ocean canyon discovered in the North Atlantic leads to an abyssal
gap in a manner which suggests a genetic relationship. All recognized mid-ocean
canyons parallel the adjacent continental margin. Although all slope downward
continuously they cut across the regional slope of the abyssal plain.</p>

<p>Mid-ocean canyons or features resembling them have been found in the
Indian Ocean Bay of Bengal (Dietz, 1953), in the northwest Atlantic (Ewing
<em>et al.</em>, 1953), the western Atlantic, and the equatorial Atlantic (Beckmann, in preparation).
Gibson (1958) has reported one in the Gulf of Alaska. Three in
the Atlantic and one in the Gulf of Alaska have been mapped. Although mid-ocean
canyons probably join with continental-margin submarine canyons, no
such connection has been mapped. Menard (1955) has recorded from the North
Pacific several crossings of features resembling the mid-ocean canyons of the
Atlantic, which he refers to as deep-sea channels.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Regional description.</em>&mdash;Abyssal gaps and mid-ocean canyons are found in
both the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">WESTERN ATLANTIC</span>: The major abyssal plains of the western Atlantic are
connected from north to south by a series of abyssal gaps and mid-ocean canyons.
The Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Canyon (Fig. 29) begins in an unknown
area north of the limit of the physiographic diagram (Ewing <em>et al.</em>, 1953). It runs
south parallel to the continental margin of the Grand Banks on the west and to
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on the east until it reaches the Southeast Newfoundland
Ridge, where it cuts through a narrow abyssal gap. After passing through the
gap, the canyon turns west, broadens, and is finally lost in the Sohm Abyssal
Plain. The mid-ocean canyon is about 3 miles wide and 50 fathoms deep north
of the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge (Fig. 30). The west wall is about 10-15
fathoms higher than the east wall (Fig. 32). The canyon has been mapped by
more than 80 echo-sounding profiles (Fig. 31). The average slope of the sea
floor at right angles to the axis of the canyon in most places exceeds the gradient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of the canyon. The gradient west to east is about 1:1500, while the gradient of
the canyon from north to south is 1:2250.</p>

<p>The mid-ocean canyon forms gentle meanders (Fig. 29). As the gradient of
the canyon decreases, the canyon changes its cross-section form from a narrow,
deep canyon to a broad, shallow one (Figs. 31 and 32).</p>

<p>The mid-ocean canyon follows an exceptionally narrow and deep abyssal gap
through the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge. At its narrowest point the gap is no
wider than the mid-ocean canyon.</p>

<p>Mid-Ocean Canyon No. 2 is nearly identical to the Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean
Canyon in shape and form (Pl. 14, fig. 2). It has been traced for only
350 miles through the northwest arm of the Sohm Abyssal Plain. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
strong suggestion of a low sill running northeast of the Bermuda Rise toward
the "tail" of the Grand Banks. Such a sill would cut off the northwest arm of
the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Mid-Ocean Canyon No. 2 would in this case be associated
with this abyssal gap connecting the higher northwest arm with the deeper
central and southern parts of the Sohm Plain. A large magnetic anomaly which
crosses the plain at this point is possibly evidence of a buried ridge beneath the
abyssal plain. Mid-Ocean Canyon No. 2 has been traced from the vicinity of
Kelvin Seamount eastward to the supposed sill. As in the case of the Northwest
Atlantic Mid-Ocean Canyon the gradient at right angles to the canyon axis
generally exceeds the gradient of the canyon floor. A systematic difference in
depth between the two walls was not found in Mid-Ocean Canyon No. 2.</p>

<p>A small area (8000 square miles) of abyssal hills lies between the northwest
arm of the Sohm Abyssal Plain and the northern edge of the Hatteras Abyssal
Plain. Although many sounding lines have been run through this area it is not
yet clear whether this area is best referred to as an abyssal gap or a sill, although
the evidence seems to favor a gap. The western end of the Sohm Plain seems to
reach a smooth sill a few dozen miles east of Caryn Peak, and the abyssal plain
surrounding Caryn Peak, at the mouth of the Hudson Canyon, seems either to
be isolated or to be connected with the Hatteras Abyssal Plain to the south
through an abyssal gap.</p>

<p>An abyssal gap may possibly connect Sohm Plain to the eastern end of the
Nares Abyssal Plain, but in consideration of the eastward gradients of the Nares
Abyssal Plain it seems probable that no gaps cut all the way through the wide
abyssal-hills province which separates the two plains. The gap connecting the
Hatteras Abyssal Plain and the Nares Abyssal Plain southwest of the Bermuda
Rise has been named Vema Gap after the Research Vessel <span class="smcap">Vema</span> which has
been used most extensively in this area. Vema Gap is about 20 miles wide and
70 miles long; its long axis is oriented approximately west-east. The Hatteras
Plain reaches a depth of 2900 fathoms a few miles west of the gap. The gradient
of the plain is about 1:3000 at that point. The Nares abyssal plain to the southeast
lies at about 3070 fathoms and slopes eastward with a gradient of about
1:3500. The floor of the gap, in sharp contrast to the adjacent plains, slopes eastward
at an average gradient of 1:300. The edge of the Hatteras Abyssal Plain
is cut by several mid-ocean canyons 20 fathoms deep and a mile wide which develop
a few miles to the west and converge on the abyssal gap. Associated with
Vema Gap is a large magnetic anomaly similar to the one observed near the supposed
gap north of the Bermuda Rise, which again could possibly be evidence
of a prominent buried ridge forming the sill of the gap.</p>

<p>The Old Bahama Channel Abyssal Plain and the Hispaniola-Caicos Abyssal
Plain are probably connected by a steep-walled abyssal gap which runs west to
east south of Great Inagua Island.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">EASTERN ATLANTIC</span>: The only abyssal gap known in the eastern Atlantic was
sounded by M/V <span class="smcap">Theta</span> and is here named Theta Gap. This gap lies off the
northwest cape of Spain between the Biscay and Iberia abyssal plains. Its existence
is based on only a few profiles, one of which is illustrated in Figure 33.
Small depressions a few fathoms deep and 1-2 miles wide were observed in the
Biscay Abyssal Plain and may represent mid-ocean canyons, which may possibly
connect with Theta Gap (Pl. 8, fig. 2). Insufficient precision-sounding tracks
are available in this area to determine the exact nature of these features.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Origin of abyssal-floor topography.</em>&mdash;The explanation that abyssal plains
represent portions of the abyssal floor buried beneath sediments transported by
turbidity currents, and that the abyssal hills represent this unburied surface, has
been offered by Heezen <em>et al.</em> (1951; 1954) and by Menard (1955). Abyssal gaps
are pictured as passages through which turbidity currents flow from a higher
plain to a lower one. Sediment must have filled in the Hatteras Plain to the
present depth of the western end of Vema Gap before the Nares Abyssal Plain
could begin to form. Ewing <em>et al.</em> (1953) suggest that the Northwest Atlantic
Mid-Ocean Canyon was probably formed by turbidity currents which flow from
the vicinity of Greenland to the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Whether the canyon-forming
process was largely erosional or depositional remains to be seen, but the
narrow, deep abyssal gap in the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge suggests erosion.
The parallelism of the Mid-Ocean Canyon with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge even
suggests a tectonic origin. The deep-sea sands of the canyon floor and its continuous
gradient argue as strongly for a turbidity-current origin. The features of
the smooth parts of the abyssal floor seem clearly the result of deposition by
turbidity currents (Ericson <em>et al.</em>, 1955; in press).</p>


<h3>OCEANIC RISES</h3>

<p><em>Definition and distribution.</em>&mdash;An oceanic rise is a large area (measured in
hundreds of miles), not connected to or included in a mid-oceanic ridge or connected
to a continental rise, which rises a few hundred fathoms above the surrounding
abyssal floor. The topography of an oceanic rise ranges from gentle to
extremely rugged.</p>

<p>Included in this classification is the Bermuda Rise and Corner Rise of the
North Atlantic, the Rio Grande Rise of the South Atlantic, and a number of
similar but unnamed features in the Indian and Pacific oceans.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Regional description.</em>&mdash;Only three oceanic rises are situated in the North
Atlantic. They are: Bermuda Rise, Corner Rise, and Rockall Rise. Of these only
the Bermuda Rise has been crossed by many echo-sounding traverses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BERMUDA RISE</span>: In the center of the North America Basin and surrounding
the island of Bermuda is an oval asymmetrical arch about 300 by 600 miles with
the long axis oriented northeast. The topography of the Bermuda Rise is relatively
gentle as compared to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge but considerably more rugged than
the continental rise (Pl. 27). The rise is usually distinctly marked on the west
by a 10- to 100-fathom decrease in depth and a change from the monotonously
smooth abyssal plain on the west to gently rolling hills, 20-50 fathoms high and
2-10 miles wide (Pl. 16). In contrast the eastern edge of the rise is marked by a
series of scarps 300-900 fathoms high (Pl. 17), and the adjacent rise topography<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
is relatively rugged. West of the scarp zone the topography is quite smooth to
the western margin of the rise (Pl. 16).</p>

<p>An apron 30 miles wide surrounds the 2300-fathom high pedestal which supports
the island of Bermuda (Pl. 20). From this apron Ericson, Ewing, and
Heezen (1952), reported quantities of shallow-water-derived carbonate clastics.</p>

<p>North of Bermuda the rise is marked by a number of high seamounts which
continue across the adjacent abyssal plain and form the Kelvin Group of seamounts.
Many of these appear to be flat-topped.</p>

<p>The Bermuda Rise is bounded on the east and north by the Sohm Abyssal
Plain, on the west by the Hatteras Plain, and on the south by the Nares Plain.
For a short distance on the northwest and a few hundred miles on the southeast
the rise is bordered by abyssal hills. The western edge of the Bermuda Rise is
formed in places by a scarp, but particularly in the northwest the Bermuda
Plateau seems to dip gently beneath the Hatteras Abyssal Plain.</p>

<p>The details of the topography of the Bermuda Rise are demonstrated by the
series of radiating profiles in Plate 27.</p>

<p>Bermuda Pedestal.&mdash;The islands of Bermuda lie along the southeast rim of a
flat-topped pedestal whose surface lies less than 20 fathoms below sea level. The
sides of the Bermuda Pedestal slope at gradients of 1:5 to 1:30 and fall rapidly
to the 2300-fathom contour where the base of the pedestal is reached. The pedestal
is 50 miles by 80 miles at its base. Cores containing Tertiary sediments and
recent reef detritus, and in one case basaltic rock, have been obtained from the
sides of the Bermuda Pedestal (Pl. 28).</p>

<p>Bermuda Apron.&mdash;Encircling the base of the Bermuda Pedestal is a smooth,
gently sloping apron or depositional terrace. The width of the apron is irregular
and ranges from 40 miles on the east to 20 miles on the west. Gradients decrease
to 1:700 away from the pedestal, but the outer edge of the apron in places has
gradients of 1:90. On some profiles hills up to 125 fathoms in height occur near
the outer edge of the apron and become increasingly numerous until at a distance
of 45 miles from the pedestal the apron is not recognizable as a topographic
feature. The limits of the apron will ultimately be defined by a study of the
sediments.</p>

<p>Bermuda Plateau.&mdash;The Bermuda Plateau is an oval area of 90,000 square
miles, which lies roughly in the center of the Bermuda Rise. The topography is
characterized by low hills and rather extensive intermontane valleys (Pl. 16).
Few individual hills exceed 50 fathoms in height. The topography of the sub-province
is well illustrated in Plate 16. The depth is 2400 to 2700 fathoms. The
plateau is bounded on the southeast by the Bermuda Scarp Zone. On the west it
extends almost to the edge of the rise. On the north the Crescent Peaks and
Muir Seamount Group have made it difficult to define the edge of the plateau.</p>

<p>Crescent Peaks.&mdash;Northwest of Bermuda a crescent-shaped line of conical
peaks borders the Bermuda Apron. Individual peaks are 600 fathoms high and
4 to 6 miles wide at their base. This range of peaks forms a distinct sub-province
which rises from the Bermuda Plateau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Bermuda Scarp Zone.&mdash;The Bermuda Plateau is broken along its eastern
margin by a series of scarps (Pl. 17). There appear to be two systems of scarps,
one trending about N. 55&deg; W. and the other about N. 35&deg; E. Individual scarps
range from 100 to 700 fathoms in height. The intersecting set of lines shown on
the province chart (Pl. 20) indicates prominent scarps in this area. Dashed lines
represent more speculative scarps. A further study of this interesting area is
underway, and it is hoped that a more-detailed mapping of these scarps will be
possible. Needless to say, dredging on these scarps should bring rich rewards in
fossil sediments and igneous rocks which are undoubtedly exposed on these
precipitous cliffs. The general character of the scarp zone is illustrated in Plate
17 by an echogram. There seem to be three or four major ne-sw scarps. In the
east-central Bermuda Rise the areas between the scarp zones remain at virtually
the same depth as the unfractured Bermuda Rise farther west. However, toward
the southeast the inter-scarp areas drop as a series of steps. The depth along the
base of each scarp is nevertheless deeper than the next lower step. The smaller
topographic features of the southeast part of the scarp zone are very similar to
the abyssal hills to the southeast and are thus probably of the same origin. The
strips between successive scarps tend to shallow to the southeast and reach minimum
depths just before the next scarp is reached.</p>

<p>Muir Seamount Group.&mdash;In 1945 workers on the U.S.S. <span class="smcap">MUIR</span> discovered
a large seamount 140 miles northeast of the Bermuda Islands. Subsequent reconnaissance
surveys by the Lamont Geological Observatory (Tolstoy, 1951; Tolstoy
and Ewing, 1949) revealed that the peak was asymmetrical in east-west
profile (considerably steeper on the east) and that the seamount was elongate
northeast-southwest parallel to the axis of the Bermuda Rise. Cores taken near
its summit contained Eocene to Pleistocene sediment. Additional seamounts have
been discovered in the area by Worzel and Shurbet (1955) and Northrop and
Frosch (1954). The asymmetrical profile and the elongate shape parallel to the
axis of the Bermuda Rise suggest that Muir Seamount is a tectonic uplift rather
than a volcanic pile, but admittedly undersea vulcanism need not always produce
symmetrical cones. As known, Muir Seamount is 35 miles wide (northwest-southeast),
60 miles long (northeast-southwest), and rises 1700 fathoms above
the Bermuda Rise. The minimum sounding recorded is 846 fathoms. The Muir
Seamount and near-by associated peaks apparently are not directly related to the
Kelvin Seamount Group farther north. The north and northwest margin of the
Bermuda Rise, like that on the west, is in some places a scarp and in other places
a gentle transition. Near the northwest corner of the Bermuda Rise a range of
hills each about 20 fathoms high and 3 miles wide follows the margin of the rise
for many miles. The northeastern margin of the Bermuda Rise is abrupt in most
places, and in some places a single scarp 500 fathoms high is all that separates
the Bermuda Rise from the adjacent abyssal plain.</p>

<p>Sediments of the Bermuda Rise.&mdash;Most of the Bermuda Rise lies below the
depth of 2500 fathoms, and thus the sediment ranges from foraminiferal clay
through red clay with a predominance of red clay. In the vicinity of the Bermuda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Pedestal calcareous detrital sediments have built a depositional apron around the
base of the pedestal in depths of 2300 to 2450 fathoms (Pl. 28). The seamounts
of the Bermuda Rise are rocky, as shown by photographs and bottom samples.
Several cores from the Muir Seamount revealed a variety of Tertiary foraminiferal
lutites. With the exception of the detrital sediments of the Bermuda Apron,
the scoured crests and flanks of the larger seamounts, and the steeper scarps, the
Bermuda Rise is covered preponderantly by pelagic sediments. This is in sharp
contrast to the surrounding abyssal plain and near-by continental rise, where
cores reveal frequent alterations of detrital and pelagic sediments (Pl. 28).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">CORNER RISE</span>: Much less extensive and less well known is Corner Rise which
lies directly south of the Grand Banks on the east side of the Sohm Abyssal
Plain. Corner Rise is so named because its northwest boundary with the abyssal
floor forms a sharp, nearly right-angled corner (Pl. 20). The main part of Corner
Rise is formed by a group of large, poorly surveyed seamounts. Several of
the peaks rise to 1500 fathoms. The area is represented in profile I of Plate 22
(between mile marks 1000 and 1200). Photographs taken on Corner Seamount
at the northwestern extremity of Corner Rise showed rippled and hard-clay
bottom to 1200 fathoms. The fact that these seamounts apparently form a prolongation
of the Kelvin Seamount Group suggests the need for detailed investigation
of the latter seamounts and the probability that additional volcanic seamounts
may be found along the same trend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ROCKALL RISE</span>: Southwest of Rockall Bank between 19&deg;W. and 23&deg;W. on the
50th parallel, rising from the abyssal floor of the northeastern Atlantic, is an ill-defined
area of irregular topography which seems not to belong to the Lower Step
of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Little is known of this area, and its classification as a
rise may not survive more detailed study. The area is illustrated in Plate 25 by
profile E-1.</p>


<h3>SEAMOUNTS OF THE OCEAN-BASIN FLOOR</h3>

<p>A seamount is defined as any isolated elevation which rises more than 500
fathoms above the sea floor. Those seamounts which lie entirely on oceanic rises
have been described as part of the rise topography. Now we will describe the
seamounts of the abyssal floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">KELVIN SEAMOUNT GROUP</span>: An impressive row of large conical peaks runs
from the vicinity of Georges Bank for 600 miles toward the northeast tip of the
Bermuda Rise. A profile plotted at natural scale which crosses five of the largest
seamounts is reproduced in Figure 34. The line of seamounts runs across the
continental rise, abyssal plain, and the Bermuda Rise, seemingly little affected on
crossing the province boundaries. The larger seamounts such as Kelvin Seamount
are about 2000 fathoms higher than the adjacent plain and are as much
as 35 miles in diameter at the base. Those which rise from the continental rise or
the abyssal plain do so abruptly, suggesting that their bases are partially buried.
The tops of most of these seamounts lie between 550 and 850 fathoms, and at
least a few are flat-topped. They are thus very similar to the flat-topped guyots
of the Pacific in size, shape, and the range of depths of their flat summits (Hamilton,
1956). Photographs taken on these seamounts showed rock, ripples and live
solitary corals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">CARYN SEAMOUNT</span>: A small conical peak, 1000 fathoms high, whose base is 8
miles in diameter, lies in the abyssal plain west of the Bermuda Rise (36&deg; 45&acute;N.).
A magnetic survey of the peak has been published by Miller and Ewing (1956).
They found an exceptionally large anomaly associated with the peak, which
clearly showed its volcanic origin. Cores from the peak contained manganese
nodules, altered volcanic rocks, and Upper Cretaceous to Recent fossils, which
shows that it is at least as old as Upper Cretaceous. The base of the peak rises
from the abyssal plain which extends out from the Hudson Submarine Delta.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">HORSESHOE SEAMOUNT GROUP</span>: About 300 miles due west from the Straits
of Gibraltar an impressive group of seamounts lies in a horseshoe-shaped arc.
Several of these, most notably Ampere and Josephine seamounts, rise to less
than 100 fathoms. Josephine Seamount is the largest of the group and lies along
an east-west topographic trend (the Azores-Gibraltar Ridge). In the southern
half of the Horseshoe Group the individual seamounts appear to be coalescing
cones similar to the seamounts of the Kelvin Group. Seamounts of the northern
half, although imperfectly known, seem to be elongated east-west. The southern
half of the group appears to resemble volcanic cones, while in the northern half
tectonic deformation seems to have played a larger part. The seamounts have
been cored, dredged, and photographed by a Lamont Observatory expedition.
The sediments obtained from the seamounts are middle Tertiary to Recent
(Sutton <em>et al.</em>, 1957).</p>

spaced photographs less than 100 feet apart.</p>

<p>Note the coarse-grained light and dark gravel in winnow row in the foreground and the
light-colored clay or ooze bottom in background. Of the sixty photographs taken at this
location three resembled Figures 2 and 3, several resembled Figure 1, and in the remainder
the ocean floor was composed entirely of the light and dark gravel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span> (Station T1-9, photo 43) Location about 50 feet from photo shown in Figure

taken here. All dredgings from Mid-Atlantic Ridge have brought up basalt and in some
cases also gabbroic and serpentinized rock. It seems likely that the rock in Figure 2 and 3
of this plate is basalt. Note the abundance of sessile life on the rocky areas in contrast to
its absence in the gravel-covered areas.</p>

<p>Positions of stations shown on Plate 30</p></div>
</div>

<p>Photographs of the seamounts generally show winnowed and rippled sediment
and rock (Pl. 15). Virtually all loose sediment is being removed from the
seamounts. The horseshoe, open to the east, encloses an abyssal plain which is,
judging from the sea-floor gradients, fed largely from the east by turbidity currents
originating in the Straits of Gibraltar and the Gulf of Cadiz areas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MILNE SEAMOUNT</span>: Early charts of the western Atlantic showed an extensive
bank of 20,000 square miles rising from the center of Newfoundland Abyssal
Plain. At about the center of this area an exceptionally high peak has been discovered
by cable ships, and the old name Milne Seamount has been assigned to
this peak. It rises more than 2500 fathoms above the abyssal floor. Two seamounts
of similar size have been found north and south of the Milne Seamount
by workers on the <span class="smcap">R. V. Atlantis</span> (Fig. 30).</p>

<p>As the abyssal floor is better surveyed many more isolated seamounts will
undoubtedly be discovered, and they may reveal tectonically significant patterns.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>


<h3>SEISMICITY OF THE OCEAN-BASIN FLOOR</h3>

<p>The ocean-basin floor provinces are virtually devoid of earthquakes of a size
detectable at distant seismic observatories. Of course small earthquakes (&lt; 5,
Richter scale) would probably not be locatable in such remote regions. The
virtual absence of larger shocks makes it improbable that many small ones occur
there either. Two earthquakes have occurred in the Bermuda Rise, one near the
west boundary and one in the scarp zone of the southeast Bermuda Rise (Pl. 29).
Several quakes were felt in Bermuda before instrumental recording was available
to permit location of their epicenters. Two quakes occurred in the abyssal
plain northwest of the Cape Verde Islands, and two were located near Theta
Gap northwest of Cape Finistere. All other earthquakes of the central part of
the ocean basin are associated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge or its eastern extension.</p>


<h3>OCEAN-BASIN FLOOR PROVINCES AND CRUSTAL STRUCTURE</h3>

<p>The results of seismic-refraction measurements in the ocean-basin floor can
be divided into two categories depending on whether the measurements were
made (1) in the abyssal floor, or (2) on an oceanic rise. Measurements in the
abyssal floor of the western Atlantic (Ewing, Sutton, and Officer, 1954) revealed
the simple pattern shown in Figure 35<em>b</em> and <em>e</em>&mdash;namely, that beneath 4-5 km
of water lies .5-1 km of sediments and sedimentary rock with a compressional-wave
velocity of about 2 km/sec, overlying 3-4 km of oceanic crustal rocks (6.5
km/sec); beneath this the sub-M mantle rocks show a velocity of about 8.1
km/sec. This pattern has been observed by most workers in the abyssal floors of
other oceans (Raitt, 1957; Hill, 1956).</p>

<p>Officer, Ewing, and Wuenschel (1952) and Katz and Ewing (1955) have
reported on the structure of the Bermuda Rise. The topographic change from
abyssal floor to the Bermuda Rise is accompanied by a corresponding change in
crustal structure (Fig. 35<em>b</em> and <em>d</em>).</p>

<p>A typical column measured on the Bermuda Plateau is shown in Figure 35<em>d</em>.
Here the sub-M velocity appears to be lower, or possibly a new intermediate-velocity
layer is inserted between the oceanic crust and the true mantle. In the
Bermuda Rise seismic velocities in the oceanic crust differ somewhat from the
typical abyssal-floor values. In the Bermuda Apron and adjacent parts of the Bermuda
Plateau (Fig. 35<em>c</em>) above the oceanic crust a thick (up to 4 km) section
of 4.5 km/sec velocity is found which has been quite reasonably identified as sedimentary
and volcanic rocks.</p>

<p>Seismic-reflection measurements in the smoother parts of the ocean-basin
floor fall into two general groups. Reflection records from the oceanic rises generally
show a succession of reflections which can be correlated for considerable
distances. Reflection records from the abyssal plains in general show many reflections
which are usually impossible to correlate even between adjacent shots. This
difference has been explained by Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen (1952) in terms
of the distribution of turbidity-current deposits. In the abyssal plains relatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
frequent turbidity flows have deposited an alternating sequence of clays and silts
which return a great number of reflections to the reflection seismograph. In contrast
the rises receive only pelagic sedimentation, and thus the layering of their
sedimentary cover is simple and widespread since it relates to major changes in
pelagic sedimentation of past geologic ages.</p>

<h2>MID-OCEANIC RIDGE</h2>


<h3>DEFINITION</h3>

<p>The third basic subdivision of the oceanic depression is the Mid-Oceanic
Ridge, a continuous median ridge which runs the length of the North Atlantic,
South Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific oceans, for more than 40,000 miles
(Heezen and Ewing, in press). In the center third of the physiographic diagram
a short segment of this world-encircling ridge is represented.</p>


<h3>MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE</h3>

<p>One can find references to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the scientific literature
dating back more than 80 years. Before the advent of the echo sounder the lateral
limits of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge were very difficult to define, and even now
widely different definitions are used. Murray (1912) mentioned that the ridge
lay in depths less than 2000 fathoms but pointed out that locally on the ridge
depths exceeded 2000 fathoms. The <span class="smcap">Meteor</span> expedition charts and profiles generally
imply by their labeling that the ridge is the area enclosed by the 4000-meter
contour (2250 fathoms). Shepard (1948) states that its "average depth is about
1500 fathoms, but it rises about 1000 fathoms above deeper zones on either side."</p>

<p>Tolstoy and Ewing (1949) and Tolstoy (1951) in general limit the ridge to
depths of less than 2500 fathoms, although in one part of the text Tolstoy and
Ewing limit it to less than 2240 fathoms, and Tolstoy (1951) implies that the
ridge extends to 2900 fathoms. In the present paper the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is
considered as a morpho-tectonic unit defined in terms of morphology, and therefore
its definition is not based on a closed isobath.</p>

<p>The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is that portion of the Mid-Oceanic Ridge system
which lies within the limits of the Atlantic Ocean. It consists of a broad, fractured
median arch or swell which occupies approximately the center third of the
ocean. Its crest lies near the median line of the ocean, and its lateral boundaries
are formed by scarps<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which lie near the axes of maximum depth of the eastern
and western basins. Adjacent to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge both to the east and to
the west is the abyssal floor (usually abyssal hills) of the ocean-basin floor.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Scarps have been seen on every recorded crossing. If they should be absent on a future
crossing, it is expected that a major change in gradient will be found which will serve as a
consistent definition for the ridge boundary.</p></div>

<p>Exaggerated profiles are useful in bringing out the major morphological characteristics
of deep-sea topography. For some purposes, however, it is desirable to
study the topography in profiles with no vertical exaggeration. Two such profiles
are shown in Figures 37-41. The position of the two profiles is indicated in
Figure 36. A very good idea of the individual slopes can be gained from a study
of these natural-scale profiles, but the province boundaries are very difficult to
identify.</p>

<p>A typical cross profile at 40:1 exaggeration is shown in Figure 42, a typical
oceanic cross section, in which each physiographic province of the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge is labelled.</p>

</div>


<h3>PROVINCES OF THE MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE</h3>

<p>The Mid-Atlantic Ridge was subdivided by Tolstoy and Ewing (1949) and
Tolstoy (1951) into (a) "the central backbone or main range which is shallower
than 1600 fathoms," and (b) "the flanks" or "the terraced zone" "between the
1600- and 2500-fathom isobaths." In this paper we use a similar but somewhat
differently defined system by dividing the provinces of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
into two categories: (1) the crest provinces, and (2) the flank provinces.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Crest provinces.</em>&mdash;The provinces of the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge consist
of (1) the Rift Valley (or Valleys); (2) Rift Mountains; and (3) High
Fractured Plateau (Fig. 43). The Azores Plateau, which forms part of the crest,
presents additional problems and is discussed separately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">RIFT VALLEY</span>: The most striking feature on an average profile across the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge is a deep notch or cleft in the crest of the ridge. In a small percentage
of the sounding profiles two or three such valleys are present, and on a
few profiles no notable depressions are observed. On an average profile the floor
of the valley lies at about 2000 fathoms, while the adjacent peaks average about
1000 fathoms below the sea surface. The width of the valley between the crests
of the adjacent peaks ranges between 15 and 30 miles, and the depth of the valley
floor beneath the highest adjacent peak ranges from 700 to 2100 fathoms. The
width of the valley 500 fathoms above its floor ranges from 5 to 22 miles. The
range in observed depths of the valley is 1150 to 2850 fathoms in the area of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
physiographic diagram. The adjacent peaks range from 500 to 1300 fathoms
within the same area (excluding the area near the Azores) (Fig. 47).</p>

<p>Twenty-six crossings of the Rift Valley are shown in Figure 45. The profiles
can be divided into three groups: (1) single well-developed rift valley; (2) several
well-developed deep valleys; (3) no particularly deep central valley. Most
of the profiles (20) fall into the first class; the second class is represented by 5,
and only 1 falls in the third class.</p>

<p>The topography of the floor of the rift is rough. In no instance has a flat floor
been observed. Where the valley is widest mountains a few hundred fathoms
high protrude from its floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">RIFT MOUNTAINS</span>: The steep walls flanking the rift each form one side of a
large rough-sided block. They might be considered as tilted blocks whose facing
slopes form the Rift Valley. The back or outer slope of the Rift-Mountains
Province is generally broken into mountains as much as 500 fathoms high and 10
miles wide (Fig. 44). The lateral limit of the Rift-Mountains Province is reached
when the average slope of the sea floor flattens markedly. Because of the high
local relief it is sometimes difficult to pick the boundary of the Rift Mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
but in almost all recorded profiles the approximate position of the boundary is
unmistakable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">HIGH FRACTURED PLATEAU</span>: The High Fractured Plateau is adjacent to the
Rift Mountains on either side of the ridge (Fig. 42). The local relief is about 400
fathoms from peak to adjacent valley, and the distance from peak to peak ranges
from 8 to 20 miles. In contrast to the adjacent flank provinces there are no filled
intermontane valleys, and the valleys are deeper and narrower than in the adjacent
Upper Step Province. Within the limits of the physiographic diagram, the
average depth of the High Fractured Plateau ranges from 1500 to 1900 fathoms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Flank provinces.</em>&mdash;Between the outer margin of the High Fractured Plateau
provinces and the level of the ocean-basin floor lies a succession of parallel provinces,
known as the Upper Step, the Middle Step, and the Lower Step. The
limits of these provinces are the least well defined of all the provinces described
in this paper. The flanks of the ridge are characterized by rough topography
(Pl. 18). Peaks of more than 200 fathoms high occur at a frequency of about
15 per 100 miles. Some of the valleys between peaks are smooth, particularly
in the provinces south of the Azores Plateau. The flanks of the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge are broken by scarps which seem to persist for relatively long distances
parallel to the trend of the crest (Pl. 20). These scarps or scarp zones break
the ridge into a succession of units here called steps (Fig. 46). An alternative
solution also seriously considered by the writers is that the steps might more
correctly be considered as a series of tilted blocks which could be referred
to as ramps. The difference between the two solutions can be appreciated by inspecting
Figures 42 and 46.</p>

<p>The writers must emphasize that the term "terraces" of Tolstoy is in no sense
the same as the term "step" used in this paper. Tolstoy defined his terraces as "a
succession of smooth shelves, each from 1 to 50 miles in width," which occupy
a zone "200-300 miles" wide. Features fitting this definition are called "intermontane
basins" in this paper, following a suggestion made by Heezen et al.
(1951).</p>

<p>The location of smooth-floored intermontane basins is shown on Plate 20.
They are found only in the area extending about 8&deg; southwest of the Azores.
Small arrows indicate the slope of the smooth floors. In general all the valleys
slope away from the crest of the ridge. Steps, on the contrary, are a succession of
average levels separated by scarps or scarp zones and in general are not smooth
except that a few basins may be filled. However, this filling is limited to a small
area south of the Azores.</p>

<p>The flanks are divided into three steps: upper, middle, and lower. The division
of anything into three parts is suspicious, whether it be a geologic period or
a physiographic region. Such divisions usually are later replaced as more information
is obtained. This is probably true of the three steps. We are more confident
of the significance of the boundaries shown on the province chart than of the
uniqueness of the enclosed areas, because each boundary marks a major scarp or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
scarp zone. The steps are defined in part in any limited area on the basis of their
mean depth. In general the Upper Step ranges from 1650 to 2300, the Middle
Step from 2250 to 2500, and the Lower Step from 2350 to 2800 fathoms. Just as
the maximum depth of the ridge and the axis of maximum depth of the basin vary
with distance along the ridge (or with latitude), so the steps vary in depth and
width (Fig. 47).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Azores Plateau.</em>&mdash;The Azores Plateau is an area of 52,000 square miles of
sea floor, surrounding the Azores Islands, where the depth is less than 1000
fathoms. The Azores Islands are oriented south-southeast-north-northwest along
a topographic trend which strikes off toward the Straits of Gibraltar. This topographic
connection between the Azores Plateau and the southern Iberian Peninsula
has been called the Azores-Gibraltar Ridge, which the present writers con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>sider
as a poorly developed mid-oceanic ridge of the same general class as the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Azores Plateau itself merges with the Rift Mountains
of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The sea-floor topographic trends of the eastern part
of the plateau are parallel to the known tectonic and volcanic trends of the Azores
Islands (Agostinho, 1937). In the western part of the Azores Plateau trends are
north-south parallel to the main trends of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Although both
W&uuml;st (1940a) and Tolstoy (1951) have published contour charts of the Azores
Plateau, it remains largely a mystery whether the trends of the eastern Azores
Plateau cross or join the axial trends of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Azores
Plateau or bulge is generally considered as a highly fractured tectonic uplift
in which vulcanism has played a comparatively small part (Cloos, 1939).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Azores-Gibraltar Ridge.</em>&mdash;An ill-defined irregular ridge runs from the eastern
end of the Azores Plateau to the Straits of Gibraltar. Largely on the basis of
its seismicity we infer that this ridge is structurally and topographically similar
to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The few existing topographic profiles across this
feature suggest that the earthquake belt is associated with a rift valley of the
same general type as the central Rift Valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Depths in
this rift appear to reach 2300-2800 fathoms, and the depth of the tops of the
adjoining mountains range from 1600 to 2000 fathoms. The flank provinces
are even less well developed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Atlantis-Plato-Cruiser-Great Meteor Seamount Chain.</em>&mdash;South of the Azores
a chain of great seamounts branches off from the High Fractured Plateau and
crosses the Upper and Middle steps in a nearly north-south direction. These seamounts&mdash;Atlantis,
Plato, Cruiser, and Great Meteor&mdash;in general have broad,
nearly flat summits at depths of 100-250 fathoms. The largest one, Great Meteor,
was discovered by workers on the <span class="smcap">Meteor</span> in 1937. This seamount, 60 miles
across at its base, rises majestically more than 2600 fathoms above the floor of
the ocean. Sands and calcareous rocks have been dredged from the summits, and
Tertiary sediments have been obtained from the flanks of the seamounts. Photographs
of the tops and of the flanks to a depth of 1600 fathoms show ripple
marks. This group is described in a paper by Heezen, Ewing, Ericson, and Bentley
(in press).</p>


<h3>GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS OF MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE
PHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCES</h3>

<p><em>Seismicity of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.</em>&mdash;The earthquake epicenters instrumentally
determined for the North Atlantic up to 1956 are shown in Plate 29.
Nearly all earthquakes fall in the crest zone. Considering that determination of
shocks is accurate only to within -&frac12;&deg; to 1&deg; +, it is quite surprising that the
plotted epicenters form such a narrow belt. Investigation of the problem of the
physiographic province most seismically active reveals that many epicenters actually
plot in the Rift Valley and that virtually all that do not are within about 1&deg;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of the Rift Valley. All seismic activity therefore is limited to the crest provinces,
and probably virtually all the activity is concentrated within the Rift-Valley
Province. A line of epicenters runs from the Rift Valley near Flores Island of the
Azores toward the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Sediments and physiographic provinces of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.</em>&mdash;The
Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the major site of undisturbed pelagic sedimentation of the
Atlantic because of its isolation from down-slope movements starting on the continental
margin. However, turbidity currents must form near the shores of
oceanic islands and the edges of shallow banks and probably contribute sediments
to the intermontane valleys. Photographs taken on the Rift Mountains and on the
sides of major seamounts show scour marks and ripple marks, indicating considerable
winnowing and scour by deep-ocean currents (Pl. 19). This sediment
carried from the tops of peaks and deposited on the steep mountain sides probably
slumps occasionally and forms turbidity currents which flow to the adjacent
valley floors (Pl. 28). For this reason cores taken in intermontane valleys and
near the higher peaks will have considerable interlayering of turbidity-current
deposits, and much of the sides and crests of individual high mountains is bare
rock. In the Rift Mountains true pelagic sediments are only occasionally found.
It is striking to note that in coring and bottom photography bare-rock slopes are
found most commonly in the Rift Mountains and High Fractured Plateau, but
flat-floored intermontane basins are absent in these provinces. This must indicate
either that the topography of the Rift Mountains is very new or that the sediment
eroded from the crest provinces is carried all the way to the Upper Step Province
where it is deposited in the intermontane basins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Rocks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.</em>&mdash;Our knowledge of the lithology of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge comes from three sources: (1) rocks dredged from the sea
floor, (2) detrital rock fragments found in sediment cores, and (3) rocks exposed
on the islands of the Ridge.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest rock dredging on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was done in
1885 by the <span class="smcap">Talisman</span> expedition. In 1949 Furon (1949) reported the occurrence
of fossil trilobites in dredge samples which had been stored for more than
half a century in a French Museum. One dredging was made in the High Fractured
Plateau of the eastern Atlantic at 42&deg; 21&acute;N., 17&deg; 12&acute;W., in 4255 meters
depth (2330 fathoms). Furon believes that the material was <em>in situ</em> and therefore
proof of early Paleozoic outcrops on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The abundant evidence
of glacially rafted rocks even as far south as 30&deg; N. casts serious doubt on
this conclusion, but nevertheless the possibility that the material might have been
<em>in situ</em> must be considered.</p>

<p>The Mid-Atlantic Ridge Expedition of 1947 led by Ewing made a number of
successful rock-dredge hauls on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The most successful
hauls were made in the Rift Valley and on the adjacent Rift Mountains at about
30&deg; N. Lat. The specimens have been described by Shand (1949), who reported
olivine gabbro, serpentine, basalt, and diabase. One limestone of probably Ter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>tiary
age was collected the same year but has not been described. The suite of
crystalline rocks obtained is similar to those found on oceanic islands elsewhere
on the Mid-Oceanic Ridge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Crustal structure and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge provinces.</em>&mdash;The crustal structure
of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge provinces has been determined at about 20 places
by the seismic-refraction technique (Fig. 35f). These studies, conducted by
John I. Ewing and W. M. Ewing (in press), have shown that the average
crustal structure of the crest provinces and Upper Step consists of 0.4 km
of low-velocity sediment and 2.8 km of rock with a velocity of 5.1 km/sec overlying
a substratum in which the velocity is 7.3 km/sec. The thickness of the layer
of low-velocity sediment varies considerably from place to place. In the crest
provinces the 5.1 km/sec layer is commonly exposed. In the flank provinces appreciable
thicknesses (to 1 km) of sediment have been measured. The sediment
seems to thicken between major scarp zones and ridges as if the sediment were
collecting in longitudinal basins parallel to the axis of the ridge. An insufficient
number of measurements have been made to determine whether these accumulations
correlate with the boundaries of individual intermontane basins or with the
limits of individual step provinces.</p>

<p>The structure of the abyssal floor, crest provinces, and flank provinces is compared
in Figure 35. The two higher-velocity layers shown in the abyssal-floor
sections (Nares and Sohm Abyssal Plain, Fig. 35), have been observed in all
measurements made in these provinces. The 6.7 km/sec layer is generally considered
to be gabbroic, and the 8.1 km/sec layer is by definition the earth's mantle.
In the Mid-Atlantic Ridge section the upper high-velocity material has an
average velocity of 5.1 km/sec and is generally identified as basaltic rock. The
velocity of the underlying material (7.3 km/sec) is intermediate between the
velocity of oceanic crustal rocks (6.7 km/sec) and that of mantle rocks (8.1 km/sec),
as observed both beneath the continents and beneath the abyssal floor.</p>

<p>Ewing and Ewing (in press) suggest that this intermediate velocity is the
result of a physical mixture of oceanic crustal rocks and mantle rocks. To explain
such large-scale mixing they propose that extensive vulcanism and intrusion
along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have produced an intermingling of the crustal and
mantle rocks, and that this was associated with convection cells in the deep mantle
which supply large quantities of basaltic magma and produce extensional forces
on the crust and upper mantle.</p>

<p>Nearly 20 crossings of the crest of the ridge have been made with the total-intensity
magnetometer towed behind research vessels employing continuously
recording echo sounders. A characteristic anomaly pattern has been noted by
Ewing, Heezen, and Hirshman (1957). The Rift Valley is characterized by a
large positive anomaly, while the adjoining Rift Mountains show negative anomalies
of 300 to 500 gammas (Fig. 48).</p>

<p>Free-air gravity anomalies over the crest provinces and Upper Step are usually
30-50 mg positive, while the Rift Valley as measured in two places gave free-air
anomalies of -3 and -20 mg.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>A heat-flow measurement by E. C. Bullard in the Rift Valley province in
the North Atlantic indicated a value of about 7 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> cal./cm<sup>2</sup>/sec. which is
about 6 times the average value of 1.2 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> cal./cm<sup>2</sup>/sec observed in the Lower
Step and abyssal floor of the eastern Atlantic (Bullard, 1954; Bullard <em>et al.</em>,
1956).</p>

<p>High heat-flow values have also been observed on the Easter Island Ridge of
the Southeast Pacific, suggesting that the entire Mid-Oceanic Ridge rift system
may be so characterized.</p>

<p>An adequate synthesis and explanation of all these converging lines of evidence
has not yet been formulated. However, the correlation of so many types of
geophysical and geological data speaks favorably for the validity and tectonic
significance of the physiographic provinces described here.</p>

<p>On the basis of the observed correspondence of crustal structure and physiographic
provinces a hypothetical trans-Atlantic structure section was prepared
(Fig. 49). Seismic-refraction measurements were projected along province
boundaries and plotted beneath an echo-sounding profile from New York to
Spanish Sahara. The black splotched areas represent the 7.3 km/sec layer. This
velocity intermediate between 8.1 km/sec of normal mantle and 6.7 km/sec of
normal oceanic crust is considered (1) a mixture of the two normal layers; (2) a
low-velocity part of the mantle, or (3) a distinct crustal layer characteristic of
mid-oceanic ridges. The structure shown for the continental margin of Africa is
based on analogy with the structure of the continental margin of northeastern
United States. This procedure seems justified by the close similarity of the continental-margin
physiographic provinces of the two areas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Origin of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.</em>&mdash;Of the many theories which have been
proposed for the origin of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge almost all have been extremely
speculative, and none has been based on any very detailed knowledge of the feature.
We are still a long way from having a comprehensive knowledge of the
Ridge. The various theories of origin and their factual basis have been briefly
reviewed by Tolstoy and Ewing, who conclude that it is impossible to say if the
feature is primarily of folded or faulted origin. In a paper in press Heezen and
Ewing compare in detail the topography and seismicity of the African rift valleys
and the Rift Valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Their conclusion is that the two
areas are of basically the same structure, and in fact both form parts of the same
continuous structural feature. Since the African rift valleys seem clearly to be
the result of normal faulting resulting from extension of the crust, Heezen and
Ewing conclude that the topography of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is largely the
result of normal faulting. Whether the forces are the result of horizontal extension
or vertical uplift remains the most important unsolved problem in connection
with the origin of the continental as well as the suboceanic rift-valley systems.
Hess (1954) has proposed a mechanism relating suboceanic uplift to expansion
due to serpentization of the upper mantle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a><br /><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>


<h3>SUB-BOTTOM REFLECTIONS RECORDED ON PRECISION DEPTH
RECORDER RECORDS AND PHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCES</h3>

<p>In some areas of the ocean PDR records show a reflecting surface a few
fathoms below the bottom. Such horizons are observed only when the sounder
is operated with a short (5-millisecond) ping length (in echo sounding the transmitted
sound is called the ping, and its duration is called the ping length). When
a long ping is used the first returning echo masks any subsequent echoes occurring
less than about 10 fathoms after the first echo. To establish continuity of the
lower horizon it is necessary to run the recorder without interruption, sending
pings once a second. Since a faulty pinging circuit or some accident of geometry
could conceivably send out two closely spaced pings, the supposed sub-bottom
echoes must be carefully checked to make sure that they are not both bottom
echoes from two closely spaced pings. If two pings were being sent out the second
echo would always symmetrically underlie the bottom surface. If, however, the
two surfaces show local variations, it can be safely concluded that the deeper one
is a true sub-bottom echo. In order to observe sub-bottom echoes the sea floor
should be reasonably smooth since in rugged relief side echoes and crossing
"highlight" hyperbolas obscure any sub-bottom echoes which might occur. Sub-bottom
echoes in the Gulf of Maine have been well described by Murray (1947).
In local inshore areas prominent sub-bottom echoes recorded by unmodified or
slightly modified standard echo sounders have been used to map basement rocks
(Smith <em>et al.</em>, 1952).</p>

<p>In the deep sea, sub-bottom echoes or "penetration" are observed most frequently
in the continental rise, oceanic rises, and the far edges of the abyssal
plains. Penetration is rare on the open continental shelf and on the continental
slope. As the depth increases, echoes are more difficult to obtain, so that records
from different depths cannot be directly compared in reference to ease of penetration.
It nevertheless seems to be true that sub-bottom echoes are rare or absent
on PDR records from the parts of the abyssal plains closest to the continental
margin. Penetration in the continental rise is common but frequently irregular
and intermittent. One of the most persistent and uniform sub-bottom reflecting
horizons observed occurs on the outer ridge east of the Bahamas (south of
30&deg; N.) (Pl. 6).</p>

<p>Records from the abyssal plain immediately adjacent to the abyssal hills
(Pl. 13 Fig. 4) and from the flat-floored tongues in the abyssal hills (Pl. 10)
reveal some of the deepest and strongest sub-bottom echoes. Good sub-bottom
echoes are common in the Bermuda Plateau.</p>

<p>The sub-bottom reflecting layers frequently crop out, and the overlying sediments
thicken and thin, revealing apparently noticeable variations in the rate of
accumulation of sediments. Outcropping of sub-bottom layers on the steeper
slopes indicate slumping, while the deepening of the sub-bottom reflecting horizon
in valleys indicates a greater rate of deposition. High-frequency sound is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
normally strongly attenuated by transmission through sediments. The observation
of sub-bottom reflections with high-frequency sound pulses (12 kc) indicates
(1) that the surface sediment is uniform and is of low density, and (2) that a
fairly sharp density change occurs beneath this surface layer of low-density material.
In areas such as the outer ridge from 22&deg; to 29&deg; N. Lat. and the southern
Bermuda Rise, it can be safely assumed that the upper layer consists of deep-sea
red clay. Density measurements on red clay have indicated values of 1.25 to 1.45.
The lack of sub-bottom reflections over the parts of the abyssal plains close to
the continents is attributed to the numerous sand and silt layers found in the
cores which reflect most of the sound. The occurrence of good reflections beneath
the outer edges of the abyssal plains could be explained by either assuming that for
a long geologic time no sand-or silt-carrying turbidity current has reached this
area, or that red clay is deposited here much faster than elsewhere.</p>

<p>An extremely prominent sub-bottom reflector observed over a vast area of
the east tropical Pacific has been identified by coring with a 10-cm thick bed of
white, vitreous ash. This suggests that sub-bottom reflections found elsewhere
may, in general, represent ash horizons. This, of course, would presuppose ash
falls so vast that some record should have been preserved on land. There is no
reason to assume that there is but a single cause of deep-sea sub-bottom echoes.</p>

<p>The widespread occurrence of the sub-bottom interface on the deeper isolated
rises may be of great importance if it be interpreted as evidence of a sudden
change in sedimentation resulting in a change from higher- to lower-density sediment.
It is just conceivable, however, that some unstable diagenetic process may
cause a sudden increase in compaction at a depth corresponding to the sub-bottom
reflection.</p>

<p>The sub-bottom reflections in depths of 2600 fathoms on the southern Bermuda
Rise and the outer ridge is about .02 second after the bottom echo, and this
indicates a layer about 10 fathoms thick. At a rate of deposition of 1 cm/1000
years this change in sediment type would have occurred 20 million years ago.</p>

<p>In a remotely situated oceanic area the factors controlling whether red clay
or <em>Globigerina</em> ooze is laid down are largely related to depth and temperature of
the bottom water. These two factors are related to those which control the solubility
of the carbonate and thus the type of bottom deposit. Emiliani and Edwards
(1953), from a study of oxygen isotopes in benthic Foraminifera in Tertiary
deep-sea sediments from the eastern Pacific, concluded that the temperature of
Pacific bottom water decreased 8&deg; C. from the Eocene to the present. This should
have caused a great increase in the solution of carbonate assuming other factors
unchanged. Sub-bottom reflections then may also be interpreted as the result of a
change in the temperature or the circulation of bottom water in the deep basin.
Extensive, basin-wide sub-bottom reflectors, whether the result of vast beds of
ash or widespread changes in pelagic sedimentation, imply events of global importance.
The further investigation and identification of these reflectors should
produce data of far-reaching application in geology, climatology, and paleo-oceanography.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF PROVINCE CHARACTERISTICS</h3>

<p>The Atlantic Ocean floor consists of three major morphological divisions:
(1) continental margin, (2) ocean-basin floor, and (3) Mid-Oceanic Ridge. The
continental margin is formed by three categories of provinces which represent
(1) the submerged continental platform, (2) the steep edge of the continental
block, and (3) the raised or depressed edge of the ocean floor. The topographic
detail of the continental margin is predominantly smooth except for the submarine
canyons and minor irregularities of the upper continental rise. A close
correspondence of topography and distribution of recent sediments is apparent.
For example, deep-sea sands are found in the submarine canyons and on the
canyon deltas of the lower continental rise. The continental slope appears to be
a thinly veneered or bare outcrop of Tertiary and Mesozoic sediments. Individual
topographic benches can be traced for many miles along the strike. On the basis
of published descriptions and dating of dredged rock, certain prominent benches
are identified as the outcrop pattern of various Cretaceous and Tertiary formations.
The lower continental rise can be directly traced into the outer ridge at
Cape Hatteras. The upper continental-rise and the marginal-trench provinces lie
between the abrupt continental slope and the outer ridge. Seismic-refraction
measurements in the continental margin indicate the greatest thickness of sedimentary
rocks under the upper continental rise. Thus if we consider the initial
form as an unfilled depression it would have been remarkably similar to the
form of the present marginal trenches.</p>

<p>The ocean-basin floor lies between the continental margin and the Mid-Oceanic
Ridge and consists of the deeper abyssal floor and the elevated oceanic
rises. On the abyssal floor adjacent to the continental margins are found the flattest
surfaces of the earth. These abyssal plains apparently were built by turbidity-current
deposits. The unburied abyssal floor is represented by the abyssal hills.
The oceanic rises are broad uplifts which rise from the abyssal floor through a
series of scarps. Oceanic rises are covered with pelagic sediments except locally
near islands and seamounts. The crustal structure of oceanic rises differs significantly
from the typical abyssal floor in having lower velocities and generally
thicker crustal layers.</p>

<p>The Mid-Oceanic Ridge is a broad fractured arch whose axis follows the
median line of the ocean. It generally covers the center third of the ocean. The
ridge provinces are divided into crest provinces and flank provinces. The crest
provinces include (1) the Rift Valley, a long axial cleft 15-30 miles wide and
500-1500 fathoms deep; (2) the Rift Mountains which form the sides of the Rift
Valley; and (3) the High Fractured Plateau, a rugged plateau which borders
the Rift Mountains. The flank provinces consist, on each side, of roughly three
steps separated by large scarps. A seismic belt accurately follows the Rift Valley.
The topography of the Mid-Oceanic Ridge seems best explained by extensive
normal faulting. The mid-oceanic Rift Valley connects with and is probably of
the same origin as the African rift valleys.</p>
